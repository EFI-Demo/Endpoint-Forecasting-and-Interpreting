Prod. Note: Things are a hot mess right now and the team thinks that there are voices you have needed to hear more than ours, so we held back on releasing a few episodes. We are releasing those now, please pardon any weeks-old info.  Be safe, be kind, and listen to each other.  Black lives matter. 

You, our audience, have asked this question a lot — in person, on Twitter, in DMs, and one of you even sent me InMail. So we spend a whole episode talking about advancing your career in the middle stages, whether you are interested in jumping on the management track or rising to the top of the engineering/technical hill, there are certain skills, relationships, and habits that will make your quest more effective. Quest? Wow, I have really been playing too many games lately.


 The timeline:

01:25 — Roundtable: Games. It’s all games.
07:15 — One question from Twitter. You’ve asked this question a lot.
08:30 — Honestly, you should write Craig’s 5 points down where you can see them often
14:00 — Nigel has great advice for every employment scenario OTHER than what we’re actually discussing
19:00 — Joel says something about listening, but I didn’t really catch it
25:38 — Understanding the bigger picture and the business
38:15 — Parting shots, closing thoughts
