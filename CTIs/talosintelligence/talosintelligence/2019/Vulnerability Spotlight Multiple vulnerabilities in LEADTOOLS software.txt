Marcin Towalski and Cory Duplantis of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities. Blog by Jon Munshaw.

Cisco Talos recently discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the LEADTOOLS line of imaging toolkits. LEADTOOLS is a collection of toolkits designed to perform a variety of functions aimed at integrating documents, multimedia and imaging technologies into applications. All of the software is produced by LEAD Technologies Inc. LEADTOOLS offers prebuilt and portable libraries with an SDK for most platforms (Windows, Linux, Android, etc.), that are all geared toward building


applications for medical systems. Various pieces of LEADTOOLS contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors to carry out a number of actions, including denial-of-service conditions and the exposure of sensitive information.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with LEAD Technologies to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.


Vulnerability details
LEADTOOLS JPEG2000 Isot parsing memory corruption vulnerability (TALOS-2019-0945/CVE-2019-5154)

An exploitable heap overflow vulnerability exists in the JPEG2000 parsing functionality of LEADTOOLS 20.0.2019.3.15. A specially crafted J2K image file can cause an out of bounds write of a null byte in a heap buffer, potentially resulting in code execution. An attack can specially craft a J2K image to trigger this vulnerability.
