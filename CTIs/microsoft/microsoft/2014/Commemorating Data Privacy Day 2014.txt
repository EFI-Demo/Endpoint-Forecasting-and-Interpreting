		Privacy is a central element of Microsoft’s Trustworthy Computing effort. Tomorrow, on Data Privacy Day (or Data Protection Day in Europe), Microsoft will join others from around the world in commemorating this annual milestone.
Data Privacy Day (DPD), which occurs annually on Jan. 28, is dedicated to raising awareness of privacy considerations and enabling the responsible use of data online.
In observance of DPD, Microsoft today released a survey which looks at consumers’ perspectives on privacy. The study found that many savvy web users would prefer that technology companies help protect their privacy through a combination of efforts, including  technology innovations that automatically protect individual privacy; simple controls to help individuals make appropriate privacy choices; and transparency about how consumer information is collected, shared and protected.
In addition, our Chief Privacy Officer, Brendon Lynch, will be participating in a DPD panel discussion hosted by the U.S.-based National Cyber Security Alliance. You can read more about DPD and Microsoft’s approach to privacy in a new blog post by Brendon: Marking Data Privacy Day with dialogue.
