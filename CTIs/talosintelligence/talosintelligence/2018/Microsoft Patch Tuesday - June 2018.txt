Critical vulnerabilities

This month, Microsoft is addressing 11 vulnerabilities that are rated "critical." Talos believes these three vulnerabilities in particular are notable and require prompt attention.

CVE-2018-8225 - Windows DNSAPI Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

A remote code vulnerability is present within Windows DNS. This vulnerability manifests due to  DNSAPI.dll improperly handling DNS responses. This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the LocalSystem account on affected systems. An attacker could leverage a malicious DNS server and send specially crafted DNS responses to trigger this vulnerability. 

CVE-2018-8229 - Chakra Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability

A remote code execution vulnerability is present within Microsoft Scripting Engine. This vulnerability manifests due to the Chakra engine improperly handling objects in memory. This vulnerability could be leveraged by attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems within the context of the current user. This vulnerability could be leveraged in web-based attacks where a user is convinced to visit a web page that has been specially crafted to exploit this vulnerability. This could be in the form of an attacker controlled webpage, or simply a page that hosts external content, such as advertisements.

CVE-2018-8267 - Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability

A remote code execution vulnerability is present within Microsoft Scripting Engine. This vulnerability manifests due to scripting engine not properly handling objects in memory in Internet Explorer. This vulnerability could be leveraged by attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems within the context of the current user. This vulnerability was publicly disclosed prior to a patch being made available.
