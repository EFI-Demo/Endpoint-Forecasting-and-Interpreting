Welcome to this week’s Threat Source newsletter — the perfect place to get caught up on all things Talos from the past week.

If you haven’t yet, there’s still time to register for this year’s Talos Threat Research Summit — our second annual conference by defenders, for defenders. This year’s Summit will take place on June 9 in San Diego — the same day Cisco Live kicks off in the same city. We sold out last year, so hurry to register!

Finally, we also have our weekly Threat Roundup, which you can find on the blog every Friday afternoon. There, we go over the most prominent threats we’ve seen (and blocked) over the past week.

Cyber Security Week in Review


Some Facebook users are being prompted to enter their email accounts’ password when signing up. Facebook says it will stop the practice, and reiterated that it never stored those passwords on any servers.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week pushed for the U.S. to adopt stronger internet privacy and election laws. Zuckerberg proposed in an interview that the federal government create an independent body that would set definitions for what terrorist content and hate speech are and should, therefore, be banned online.
Google’s latest security bulletin warns of three critical vulnerabilities in the Android operating system. These bugs could allow an attacker to remotely take over a device by tricking the user into opening a malicious file.
Australia and Singapore introduced new laws that impose harsh punishments on websites that do not remove violent content quickly. The countries hope to reduce the amount of pro-terrorist content circulating online. 
The parent company behind Planet Hollywood and Buca di Beppo says more than 2 million customers had their credit card information stolen. The restaurants say a credit card skimming malware existed on their point-of-sale system for months. 
Bayer, one of the largest chemicals companies in the world, says it suffered a cyber attack, but no data was taken. The German company said an APT spied on its networks for months, but it so far has not discovered any “data outflow.”
Two third-party app developers may have publicly exposed more than 2 million Facebook users’ personal records. Security researchers say they discovered the two data sets on exposed Amazon Web Services S3 servers.
A major cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea says it lost millions of dollars worth of currencies in a heist. Bithumb says it believes the attack was carried out by a group of insiders.
Cisco says two patches released earlier this year for its routers do not work properly. The company says its seen live attacks on the RV320 and RV325 routers and are working on a new fix.
