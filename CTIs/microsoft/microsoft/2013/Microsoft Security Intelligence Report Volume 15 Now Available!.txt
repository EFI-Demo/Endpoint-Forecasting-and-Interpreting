		This morning, at the RSA Europe conference, Mike Reavey, General Manager for Trustworthy Computing delivered a keynote in which he announced the release of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report volume 15 (SIRv15).  The Microsoft Security Intelligence Report is the most comprehensive cybersecurity threat intelligence report in the industry that analyzes and provides in-depth perspectives on exploits, vulnerabilities, and malware for more than 100 countries/regions worldwide.  It is designed to provide prescriptive guidance which can help our customers manage risk and protect their assets.
In addition to many other key learnings, the report examines the security risks of running unsupported software and looks at the implications of using Windows XP once support, including security updates, ends on April 8, 2014.  I encourage you to check out my post titled “New Cybersecurity Report Details Risk of Running Unsupported Software” on the Microsoft on the Issues blog which discusses the data on this topic in greater detail for more information.  To download the new Security Intelligence Report, please visit www.microsoft.com/sir.
