We welcome the Cynet engine to VirusTotal. In the words of the company:


“Cynet 360 is an autonomous breach protection platform that includes multi-layered anti malware capabilities including AI-based static analysis, process behavior monitoring, memory monitoring, sandboxing, and granular whitelisting, interlocking together to protect against malicious executables, exploits, scripts, Macros, LOLbins, malicious process injection and other fileless attacks. Cynet 360 protection ranges across the entire malware lifecycle identifying malicious attributes in either the pre-execution stage by analyzing the file in its binary form or across multiple stages throughout the process execution.”

Cynet has expressed its commitment to follow the recommendations of AMTSO and, in compliance with our policy, facilitates this review by Virus Bulletin, an AMTSO-member tester.
