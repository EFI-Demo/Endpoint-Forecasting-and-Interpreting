Vulnerability discovered by Piotr Bania of Cisco Talos.


Cisco Talos, in conjunction with Apple’s security advisory issued on Mar 22, is disclosing the discovery of a local vulnerability in the communication functionality of the Apple Intel HD3000 Graphics kernel driver. This vulnerability was initially discovered by the Talos Vulnerability Research & Development Team and reported in accordance with responsible disclosure policies to Apple.

There is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Apple Intel HD3000 Graphics kernel driver (TALOS-2016-0088/CVE-2016-1743) which Talos has identified on OS X 10.11. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires user interaction, such as executing a malicious executable received via email or downloaded and run on the user's Mac. With OS X becoming more common in the workplace this can be especially impactful as the common user accounts often do not have root-level permissions.


Advisory Summary
This vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted IOConnectCallMethod request to the Apple Intel HD3000 Graphics driver, the faulting code is in the IOGen575Shared::new_texture function.






Successful exploitation can result in an escalated privilege for the attacker, who can then use root-level access for further malicious activity.
