Microsoft Active Protections Program
In August 2008, Microsoft introduced the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) to help protect computer users from criminals attempting to exploit software vulnerabilities. MAPP members comprise more than 80 security software providers worldwide who receive early access to security vulnerability information before the Microsoft security update is released.
Battling Botnets
In 2010, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU), in conjunction with law enforcement agencies and other organizations, began taking legal action to disrupt the operation of criminal botnets in several locations around the world. The takedown of these botnets reduced junk mail across the Internet significantly.
