Vulnerability Details

A vulnerability (CVE-2016-9244) was recently disclosed affecting various F5 products due to the way in which the products handle Session IDs when the non-default Session Tickets option is enabled. By manipulating the Session IDs provided to affected products, an attacker could potentially leak up to 31 bytes of uninitialized memory. This vulnerability can be used to retrieve potentially sensitive information from affected devices such as SSL session IDs from other sessions, or the contents of uninitialized memory. 

It is important to note that the number of bytes returned in the Ticketbleed attack is small (up to 31 bytes). This means that it would likely take a significant number of requests to successfully obtain sensitive information. Also, it does not appear that an attacker could predict or control the contents of memory that are returned when exploiting this vulnerability. F5 has released a Knowledge Base article (K05121675) describing which products are affected as well as mitigation instructions.
