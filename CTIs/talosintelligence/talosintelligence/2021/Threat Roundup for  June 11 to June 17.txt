    



Today, Talos is publishing a glimpse into the most
prevalent threats we've observed between June 11 and
June 17. As with previous roundups, this post isn't meant to
be an in-depth analysis. Instead, this post will summarize the threats
we've observed by highlighting key behavioral characteristics,
indicators of compromise, and discussing how our customers are automatically
protected from these threats.


As a reminder, the information provided for the following threats
in this post is non-exhaustive and current as of the date of
publication. Additionally, please keep in mind that IOC searching
is only one part of threat hunting. Spotting a single IOC does not
necessarily indicate maliciousness. Detection and coverage for the
following threats is subject to updates, pending additional threat
or vulnerability analysis. For the most current information, please
refer to your Firepower Management Center,
Snort.org, or
ClamAV.net.



For each threat described below, this blog post only lists 25 of the
associated file hashes and up to 25 IOCs for each category. An
accompanying JSON file can be found here
that includes the complete list of file hashes, as well as all other IOCs
from this post. A visual depiction of the MITRE ATT&CK techniques
associated with each threat is also shown. In these images, the brightness
of the technique indicates how prevalent it is across all threat files where
dynamic analysis was conducted.  There are five distinct shades that are used,
with the darkest indicating that no files exhibited technique behavior and the
brightest indicating that technique behavior was observed from 75 percent or
more of the files.


The most prevalent threats highlighted in this roundup are:

    Exploit Prevention
    
    Cisco AMP for Endpoints protects users from a variety of malware functions with exploit
    prevention. Exploit prevention helps users defend endpoints from memory attacks commonly
    used by obfuscated malware and exploits. These exploits use certain features to bypass
    typical anti-virus software, but were blocked by AMP thanks to its advanced scanning
    capabilities, even protecting against zero-day vulnerabilities.
    

    
    
    
        
        
            Process hollowing detected - (12418)
        
    
    
        
            Process hollowing is a technique used by some programs to avoid static analysis. In typical usage, a process is started and its obfuscated or encrypted contents are unpacked into memory. The parent then manually sets up the first stages of launching a child process, but before launching it, the memory is cleared and filled in with the memory from the parent instead.
        
    
    
        
        
            Excessively long PowerShell command detected - (5736)
        
    
    
        
            A PowerShell command with a very long command line argument that may indicate an obfuscated script has been detected. PowerShell is an extensible Windows scripting language present on all versions of Windows. Malware authors use PowerShell in an attempt to evade security software or other monitoring that is not tuned to detect PowerShell based threats.
        
    
    
        
        
            Reverse tcp payload detected - (2106)
        
    
    
        
            An exploit payload intended to connect back to an attacker controlled host using tcp has been detected.
        
    
    
        
        
            Crystalbit-Apple DLL double hijack detected - (1682)
        
    
    
        
            Crystalbit-Apple DLL double hijack was detected. During this attack, the adversary abuses two legitimate vendor applications, such as CrystalBit and Apple, as part of a dll double hijack attack chain that starts with a fraudulent software bundle and eventually leads to a persistent miner and in some cases spyware deployment.
        
    
    
        
        
            A Microsoft Office process has started a windows utility. - (810)
        
    
    
        
            A process associated with Microsoft Office, such as EXCEL.exe or WINWORD.exe, has started a Windows utility such as powershell.exe or cmd.exe. This is typical behavior of malicious documents executing additional scripts. This behavior is extremely suspicious and is associated with many malware different malware campaigns and families.
        
    
    
        
        
            Kovter injection detected - (601)
        
    
    
        
            A process was injected into, most likely by an existing Kovter infection. Kovter is a click fraud Trojan that can also act as an information stealer. Kovter is also file-less malware meaning the malicious DLL is stored inside Windows registry and injected directly into memory using PowerShell. It can detect and report the usage of monitoring software such as wireshark and sandboxes to its C2. It spreads through malicious advertising and spam campaigns.
        
    
    
        
        
            Squiblydoo application control bypass attempt detected. - (451)
        
    
    
        
            An attempt to bypass application control via the "Squiblydoo" technique has been detected. This typically involves using regsvr32.exe to execute script content hosted on an attacker controlled server.
        
    
    
        
        
            Dealply adware detected - (403)
        
    
    
        
            DealPly is adware, which claims to improve your online shopping experience. It is often bundled into other legitimate installers and is difficult to uninstall. It creates pop-up advertisements and injects advertisements on webpages. Adware has also been known to download and install malware.
        
    
    
        
        
            IcedID malware detected - (209)
        
    
    
        
            IcedID is a banking Trojan. It uses both web browser injection and browser redirection to steal banking and/or other financial credentials and data. The features and sophistication of IcedID demonstrate the malware author's knowledge and technical skill for this kind of fraud, and suggest the authors have previous experience creating banking Trojans. IcedID has been observed being installed by Emotet or Ursnif. Systems infected with IcedID should also be scanned for additional malware infections.
        
    
    
        
        
            CVE-2019-0708 detected - (141)
        
    
    
        
            An attempt to exploit CVE-2019-0708 has been detected. The vulnerability, dubbed BlueKeep, is a heap memory corruption which can be triggered by sending a specially crafted Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) request. Since this vulnerability can be triggered without authentication and allows remote code execution, it can be used by worms to spread automatically without human interaction.
