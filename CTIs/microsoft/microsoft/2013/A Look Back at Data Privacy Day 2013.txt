		Each year, Data Privacy Day (DPD) provides an opportunity to pause and reflect on our longstanding privacy program and how we can continue to evolve our efforts.  I’m proud of our dedicated group of privacy professionals who work diligently every day to help protect privacy as we deliver new innovations, and how DPD helps drive awareness among customers and Microsoft employees about our comprehensive approach to privacy.
I want to provide a quick look back at what we did to mark DPD 2013:
• We commissioned new research to better understand people’s online privacy perceptions and expectations. The results showed that people need more help controlling their personal information online and led us to introduce a new resource that does just that: microsoft.com/yourprivacy. Here, consumers can find a new video series called “Privacy in Action.” These videos illustrate many of the privacy options available in our products, and we’ll continue to update this series.

We already know our customers want and expect strong privacy protections to be built into our products, devices and services, and for companies to be responsible stewards of consumers’ data. We’ve been focused on this area for more than 10 years as part of Trustworthy Computing at Microsoft.  But, that’s just the start. Keep an eye on microsoft.com/yourprivacy as we roll out more resources to help people understand their privacy options.
• On Wednesday, 23 January I took part in a Churchill Club discussion on the “Privacy Gap” that exists in our increasingly data-rich, mobile-centric world.  I underscored the potential benefits of focusing more on the use of data as privacy reputation drives an increasing number of decisions consumers make about the products and services they use.  We live-tweeted the conversation via @MSFTPrivacy—search #DPD13.
• On Monday, 28 January I joined representatives of Facebook and MasterCard to discuss data stewardship and privacy with Ari Schwartz, Senior Policy Advisor, Office of the Secretary, US Department of Commerce.  This panel was part of the National Cyber Security Alliance’s annual Data Privacy Day event.
The Ponemon Institute also released its annual “Most Trusted Companies for Privacy” study on DPD.  We’re humbled that Microsoft ranked in the top 20—this recognition helps validate how seriously we take our privacy responsibilities and our commitment to putting people first.
