Recorded June 12, 2019 — God knows why, but we bring you another live episode from the Talos Threat Research Summit at Cisco Live U.S. in San Diego, California. We are joined by TTRS keynote speaker (as is tradition) Liz Wharton.

Catch the highlights of the show and stick around for hot takes from the live audience. Thanks to everyone who showed up to the recording, especially those brave enough to step up to the mic at the end.

This is our annual reminder of why we don’t do this more often. We think you'll whole-heartedly agree.


The timeline:

01:00 — Roundtable: The Dark Time delusion, Matt has a fit with an important lesson, UrbanSimulator 
11:00 — Talos Threat Research Summit recap: It’s live, we wander. I think someone mentioned biomes?
38:00 — Parting shots and closing thoughts
44:00 — Parting shots part 2: WITH THE AUDIENCE
