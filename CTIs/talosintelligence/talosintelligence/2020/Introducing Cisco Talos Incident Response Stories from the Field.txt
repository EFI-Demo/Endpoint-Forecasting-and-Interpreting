As another way of bringing our boots-on-the-ground intelligence to defenders, customers and users, we are introducing a new video series called "Cisco Talos Incident Response: Stories from the Field."



In each entry, a CTIR team member will cover one specific incident or lesson that they feel can be applicable to the everyday defender. First up is Pierre Cadieux, who recalls a recent incident at a health care company. He walks through the containment of the attack and recounts some lessons from that event he shares with other customers.
