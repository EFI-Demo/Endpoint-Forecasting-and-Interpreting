Ep. #41 show notes: 
Recorded Nov. 9, 2018 — We tried to make this episode last week, but thanks to some technical difficulties, we ended up calling that one a practice run. Here is take two, focused on recent sextortion scams and the pending machine learning apocalypse. We also review why vulnerability discovery and red teams are the most import line items in your security budget by looking a recent story where a breach cost dozens of lives.
