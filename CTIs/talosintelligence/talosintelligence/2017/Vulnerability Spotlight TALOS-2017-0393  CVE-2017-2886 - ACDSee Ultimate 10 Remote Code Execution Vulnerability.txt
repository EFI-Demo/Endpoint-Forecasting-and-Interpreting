Vulnerability discovered by Piotr Bania of Cisco Talos.


Overview

Talos has discovered a remote code execution vulnerability in the ACDSee Ultimate 10 application from ACD Systems International Inc. Exploiting this vulnerabilities can potentially allow an attacker to gain full control over the victim's machine. If an attacker builds a specially crafted .PSD (Photoshop) file and the victim opens it with the ACDSee Ultimate 10 application, the attackers code could potentially be executed with the privileges of the local user.



Details



An memory corruption vulnerability exists in the .PSD parsing functionality of ACD Systems International Inc. ACDSee Ultimate 10. An attacker can build a specially crafted PSD file that uses this bug to trigger a memory corruption. A byte value is taken directly from the .PSD file and used later as a size argument to the C++ memmove function. An attacker can use this to overwrite large parts of memory to crash the application or potentially even execute arbitrary code by overwriting critical control flow structures.Â For additional information, please see the advisory here.
