		We’ve received reports about a new phishing scam email that tells “email users across the world” to validate their email account or it will be deleted from “the world email server.”
This email is fake, but it does use the official logo of the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU). The Microsoft DCU is a real worldwide team of lawyers, investigators, technical analysts, and other specialists partnering internationally to disrupt cybercrime and transform the fight against digital crime to make the world safer.
If you receive an email like this you can ignore it and delete it. You can also report it.
This email contains three of the common signs of a scam:

Impersonation of a well-known company or organization
Time-sensitive threats to delete your account
Requests to click a link in an email
