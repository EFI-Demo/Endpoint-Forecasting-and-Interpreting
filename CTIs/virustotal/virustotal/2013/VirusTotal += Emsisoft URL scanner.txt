Emsisoft has been a long-time friend of VirusTotal, enhancing our file scan reports with their antivirus signatures. Its anti-malware product incorporates different protection layers, one of which they describe as follows:

SURF PROTECTION: If you unintentionally try to access a website that spreads trojans or spyware, Emsisoft Anti-Malware will prevent you from doing so. The built-in list of known dangerous and fraudulent websites is automatically updated every hour.
The guys over at Emsisoft are committed to continue making the Internet a safer place, as of today, in addition to their file scanner, VirusTotal URL scan reports will also integrate their threat intelligence regarding malicious URLs.

This is an example of a URL scan report where they produce a malicious verdict:

We are really grateful for the quick turnaround that the Emsisoft team has had in integrating their solution, thank you!
