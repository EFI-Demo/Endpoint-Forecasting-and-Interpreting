By Jon Munshaw.In our continued coverage of election security, we decided to sit down with four Talos and Cisco researchers to discuss disinformation.As we outlined in our recent research paper, disinformation is one of the cornerstones of threat actors' efforts to disrupt the American election process. In this video, we dive even deeper to discuss things like how legitimate websites can fall victim to disinformation campaigns and what can be done to stop the spread of fake news. You can watch the full discussion above or over on our YouTube page.For more, check out our full paper on disinformation here and our broad overview of election security in "What to expect when you're electing."
