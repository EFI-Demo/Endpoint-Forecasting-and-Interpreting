Vulnerability Details


Foscam IP Video Camera Firmware Recovery Unsigned Image Vulnerability (TALOS-2017-0378 / CVE-2017-2871)

Foscam C1 HD Indoor cameras provide multiple ways to recover from firmware corruption without requiring physical device access. One of the ways allows for the hosting of firmware images on a TFTP server. When the device reboots, it will look for a TFTP server present on the same subnet as the device. An attacker with access to the same subnet as the affected device could leverage this functionality to perform a firmware upgrade on the device without requiring authentication. This could be used to replace the device's firmware with a specially crafted image, and result in complete device compromise. TALOS-2017-0378 has been assigned CVE-2017-2871. For additional information, please see the advisory here.


Versions Tested

Talos has tested and confirmed that the following Foscam firmware versions are affected:

Foscam Indoor IP Camera C1 Series
System Firmware Version: 1.9.3.18
Application Firmware Version: 2.52.2.43
Plug-In Version: 3.3.0.26


Conclusion

One of the most commonly deployed IP cameras is the Foscam C1. In many cases, these devices may be deployed in sensitive locations. They are marketed for use in security monitoring, and many people use these devices to monitor their homes, children and pets remotely. As such, it is highly recommended that the firmware running on these devices be kept up-to-date to ensure the integrity of the devices, as well as the confidentiality of the information and environments that they are monitoring. Foscam has released a firmware update, available here, to resolve this issue. Users of affected devices should update to this new version as quickly as possible to ensure that their devices are not vulnerable.
