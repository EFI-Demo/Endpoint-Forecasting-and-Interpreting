Vulnerability details
Adobe Acrobat Reader DC text field value remote code execution vulnerability (TALOS-2018-0714)

Adobe Acrobat Reader supports embedded JavaScript in PDFs to allow for more user interaction. However, this gives the attacker the ability to precisely control memory layout, and it poses an additional attack surface. If the attacker tricks the user into opening a PDF with two specific lines of JavaScript code, it will trigger an incorrect integer size promotion, leading to heap corruption. It’s possible to corrupt the heap to the point that the attacker could arbitrarily execute code on the victim’s machine.
