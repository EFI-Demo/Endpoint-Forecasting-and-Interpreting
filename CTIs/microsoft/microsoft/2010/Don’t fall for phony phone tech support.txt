Cybercriminals have started calling people on the telephone, claiming to be from Microsoft, and offering to help solve their computer problems. Once cybercriminals have gained a victim’s trust, they can do one or more of the following:

Trick people into installing malicious software on their computer.
Take control of a victim’s computer remotely and adjust settings in order to leave the computer vulnerable.
Request credit card information so that cybercriminals can bill for the phony services.

Microsoft will not make unsolicited phone calls to help you with your computer. If you receive a phone call like this, hang up. 
If you think you might be a victim of fraud, you can report it. For more information, see What to do if you’ve responded to a phishing scam.
