We keep increasing the number of engines integrated in virustotal's URL scanning backbone. Today is the turn of OpenPhish. OpenPhish is a service developed by FraudSense, whose engine was integrated a couple of weeks ago, that serves as a free repository of phishing sites detected with FraudSense's Phishing Detection Technology.

In their own words:

OpenPhish is a free service that provides a continuously updated feed of global phishing URLs that were detected by FraudSense's Phishing Detection Technology. The feed includes phishing sites from the past 7 days and is updated in real time with newly detected ones.
The feed is publicly available at:
http://www.openphish.com/

It is also served as plain text at the following URL:
http://www.openphish.com/feed.txt

An example of a report containing an OpenPhish report can be found below:

Hopefully this new addition will beef up virustotal's detection capabilities when it comes to phishing sites, which even though is an old scam, it is still very extended and a common threat for the average Internet user.

Welcome OpenPhish!
