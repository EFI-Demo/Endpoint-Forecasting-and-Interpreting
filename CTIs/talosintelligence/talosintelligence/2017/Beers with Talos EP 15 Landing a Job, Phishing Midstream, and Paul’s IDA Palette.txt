EP15 Show Notes: 


In this EP, we take on interviewing and finding a job with technical questions and tests (hint: don’t oversell yourself, and make sure your mute button actually works). We also talk about enabling users with security as opposed to hobbling them. When Craig brings up the Google Home Mini beta test issues, he ends up taking a ration over his choices in handling the situation. We also discuss some clever new phishing techniques that insert malware links *mid-conversation* with a trusted party.



Spoiler alert: Joel turns out to be an Apple apologist.  Make sure to subscribe on iTunes, Google Play, or Stitcher to make sure you don't miss an episode!
