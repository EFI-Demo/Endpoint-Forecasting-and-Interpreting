Newsletter compiled by Jon Munshaw.Good afternoon, Talos readers.  The Russian APT Turla is one of the most notorious threat actors out there today. And they aren't stopping, recently adding a new backdoor to their arsenal that serves as a "last chance" to retain a foothold on victim machines, even after their other malware has been removed.Elsewhere on the APT landscape, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released an advisory warning users and organizations about a recent spike in Conti ransomware attacks. Their report even included a Talos shout-out! If you want to read our recent work on Conti, you can check out our major takeaways from their leaked playbook, and an episode of Talos Takes covering the matter.Upcoming Talos public engagementsChats, Cheats, and Cracks: Abuse of Collaboration Platforms in Malware Campaigns at BSides CharlotteSpeaker: Edmund BrumaghinDate: Sept. 25 at 1:30 p.m. ETLocation: VirtualDescription: Join Edmund Brumaghin from Talos Outreach where he'll be discussing malware campaigns targeting collaboration apps such as Discord and Slack.

The company also quietly patched a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to unlock a device using its facial ID features with a 3-D printed version of the user's face. Customer service company TTEC fully recovered from a ransomware attack. The company had to take some of its services offline, affecting customers like Verizon, after the attack on Sept. 12.The U.S. government announced new sanctions against a popular cryptocurrency exchange that officials say attackers used to launder money made in ransomware attacks. The sanctions ban U.S. citizens and companies from transacting with the group.A Russian threat actor demanded a $5.9 million ransom payment from an Iowa grain cooperative after a cyber attack this week. The company was able to recover and develop a workaround so that none of its shipments or operations were disrupted. European police arrested more than 100 individuals charged with carrying out various cybercrime for the Italian mafia. The suspects are charged with SIM swapping and carrying out phishing attacks.A popular voice-over-IP service is experiencing disruptions as of Thursday afternoon due to a distributed denial-of-service attack.

An unknown number of citizens may have had their personal information compromised, including full names and social security numbers.Lithuanian cybersecurity researchers warned their government to stop using Chinese-produced mobile devices after they discovered several privacy concerns and security holes in the products. Some banned phrases on the phones include "Free Tibet" and "Voice of America."Notable recent security issuesTitle: High-profile Russian APT develops new backdoor tool Description: Cisco Talos found a previously undiscovered backdoor from the Turla APT that we are seeing in the wild. This simple backdoor is likely used as a second-chance backdoor to maintain access to the system, even if the primary malware is removed. It could also be used as a second-stage dropper to infect the system with additional malware. The adversaries installed the backdoor as a service on the infected machine. They attempted to operate under the radar by naming the service "Windows Time Service," like the existing Windows service. The backdoor can upload and execute files or exfiltrate files from the infected system. In our review of this malware, the backdoor contacted the command and control (C2) server via an HTTPS encrypted channel every five seconds to check if there were new commands from the operator. ClamAV signature: Win.Trojan.Turla-9891506-1 Cisco Secure OSQueryTitle: Microsoft releases updated protection for OMIGOD vulnerabilities Description: Microsoft updated its patches for the so-called “OMIGOD” vulnerabilities in Open Management Infrastructure. The most severe vulnerability, CVE-2021-38647, could allow an attacker to remotely execute code. The three others (CVE-2021-38648, CVE-2021-38645 and CVE-2021-38649) could allow an adversary to obtain higher-level privileges on the targeted machine. Microsoft first disclosed these vulnerabilities last week as part of its monthly Patch Tuesday. However, security researchers found that some Linux machines could still be attacked using these exploits, prompting Microsoft to release updated guidance.  Snort SID: 58169 Most prevalent malware files this weekSHA 256: c1d5a585fce188423d31df3ea806272f3daa5eb989e18e9ecf3d94b97b965f8eMD5: 9a4b7b0849a274f6f7ac13c7577daad8 Typical Filename: ww31.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: W32.GenericKD:Attribute.24ch.1201SHA 256: 6c62b768d8b22888724288af038bc0b6e55280ddbbe42a436cdf68889346df18 MD5: 830ffb393ba8cca073a1c0b66af78de5 Typical Filename: smbscanlocal0902.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: MS17010::mURLin::W32.Auto:6c62b768d8.in03.Talos SHA 256: 8b4216a7c50599b11241876ada8ae6f07b48f1abe6590c2440004ea4db5becc9  MD5: 34560233e751b7e95f155b6f61e7419a  Typical Filename: SAntivirusService.exe  Claimed Product: A n t i v i r u s S e r v i c e  Detection Name: PUA.Win.Dropper.Segurazo::tpd SHA 256: 9f1f11a708d393e0a4109ae189bc64f1f3e312653dcf317a2bd406f18ffcc507 MD5: 2915b3f8b703eb744fc54c81f4a9c67f Typical Filename: VID[1].dat Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: Win.Worm.Coinminer::1201 SHA 256: fad16599a866f466bdeff2a716b9aa79faa6677f2895f0b262cf9402deb4b66c MD5: 04c1f4395f80a3890aa8b12ebc2b4855 Typical Filename: zReXhNb Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: Auto.FAD16599A8.241842.in07.Talos Keep up with all things Talos by following us on Twitter. Snort, ClamAV and Immunet also have their own accounts you can follow to keep up with their latest updates.
