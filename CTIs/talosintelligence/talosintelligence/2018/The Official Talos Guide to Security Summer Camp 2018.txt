It is once again time for the week in the summer when many of us descend on Las Vegas for Black Hat, DEF CON, and B-Sides LasVegas. This is your official guide to what the Cisco Talos Threat Intelligence team is doing at these shows and what some of our colleagues around Cisco Security are doing, as well.

Whether you are looking to catch some great talks, hunting down the best parties, or just trying to avoid LineCon in all it's forms, here is a quick run-down of where and how you can catch Talos speakers, Cisco events, and other fun stuff you don't want to miss. Read on for the full details of what Cisco has in store for this year.

Coming early for BSides or staying for DEFCON?
We have a few things going on there, too.

Make sure to stop by Hire Ground at BSides for resume review and tips with Cisco/Talos technical recruiter Merilyn Tinana. 
There are two DEF CON sessions that are not to be missed as well: Playback: A TLS 1.3 Story with Alejo Murillo Moya and Alfonso Garcia Alguacil at DEF CON Track 2 and Analyzing VPN Filter’s Modbus Module  Talos researchers Patrick DeSantis & Carlos Pacho in the DEF CON ICS Village (see schedule above).

Friendly Reminders:
There are a lot of things you should know before heading to Black Hat, DEF CON, and/or BSides LV. Here’s a quick list of things to absolutely remember:

Business cards
Spare battery/juice pack — nothing drains devices like a conference, although turning off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios helps and may not be a terrible idea (especially at these conferences in particular). If you aren’t charging, you are probably going to have a dead phone by the time the parties start in the evening.
Comfortable walking shoes — yes, many venues are connected, but they are connected via long walks. Many attendees rack up more than 10 miles per day on their pedometers.
Space in your suitcase — all that sweet, sweet conference swag isn't shipping itself home.
Water — because it's the desert. Pro-tip: arrange a delivery from Prime Now, Instacart, etc. on your arrival day to make sure you always have a full bottle of water.

We are looking forward to meeting and seeing everyone at Black Hat and DEF CON. Be sure to come by booth #504 and say hello …and, of course, pick up a new, limited edition Snorty pig for your collection.
