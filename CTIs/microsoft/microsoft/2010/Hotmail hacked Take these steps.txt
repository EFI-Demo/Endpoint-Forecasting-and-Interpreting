		We received this question in response to our
post about Microsoft’s new Internet
Fraud Alert.
I am a
victim of an online ID theft fraud (my Hotmail account has been hacked). What
can I do? What agency can I report this crime to for further investigation?
If you believe that your Hotmail mail account has been
compromised, but you still have access to your account, you should:


Change your password. (On the Windows Live
Hotmail Web site sign-in page, clickForgot your password?)

Update and change the secret question and answer
used to recover your password.

Update and change the alternative email address
that you use on your account.

For more information, see Account
Compromise: Unauthorized Account Access.
If you no longer have access to your account to change your
password or update your account, you can get help from a support agent. You
will need to supply a current email address and be able to answer questions
about information that you have already provided when you signed up for your
account. For more information, see Account Password Recovery.
Note: The agent will only help you if you’ve already tried
the methods described above. 
If you think that personal information from your Hotmail
account has been used to commit ID theft, you can contact the following
authorities:

Your credit card company, if you
     have given your credit card information. The sooner an organization knows
     your account may have been compromised, the easier it will be for them to
     help protect you.
The Federal Trade Commission (In the
     United States). Report the circumstances to the FTC: National
     Resource for Identity Theft.
The Anti-Phishing Working Group at spam@uce.gov.
