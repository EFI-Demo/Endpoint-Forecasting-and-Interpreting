The dropper part has the following flow of execution: Drops Drops&executes Executes Eraser Deletes Executes Virtual AllocRtl MoveMemory RtlZero Memory SHELLCODE %temp% RealDropperSyLog.bin Drops and executes C:\Program Files\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint
The backdoor part has the following execution flow:Decrypts&loads Decrypts&executes RasTlsc.exe LoadsFake rastls.dllSyLog.
When executed, this binary decrypts its resource (XOR with a 128-byte, hardcoded key) and decompresses the decrypted data (LZMA). The legitimate RobotoSlab-Regular.ttf 
(SHA1:912895e6bb9e05af3a1e58a1da417e992a71a324) file is written into the %temp% folder and run via Win32 API function ShellExecute.
The shellcode decrypted from the resource is executed. After its execution, the fake font updater drops another application whose sole purpose is to delete the dropper. This "eraser" application is dropped as %temp%\[0-9].tmp.exe.
If the process is running with administrator privileges, then the malware achieves persistence by creating a service, else the classic Windows "Run" registry key is used (HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run;DeviceAssociationService;rastlsc.exe).
After its execution, the fake font updater drops another application whose sole purpose is to delete the dropper.
It recreates an executable in memory: it decrypts all the sections and computes the necessary relocations and other offsets.
If the dropper is executed with administrator privileges, then it tries to write the following files in the C:\Program Files\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection\12.1.671.4971.104a\DeviceAssociationService\ folder else it writes them in the %APPDATA%\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection\12.1.671.4971.104a\DeviceAssociationService\ folder:
• rastlsc.exe (SHA1:2616da1697f7c764ee7fb558887a6a3279861fac, copy of legitimate Symantec Network Access Control application, dot1xtra.exe)
• SyLog.bin (SHA1:5689448b4b6260ec9c35f129df8b8f2622c66a45, encrypted backdoor)
• rastls.dll (SHA1:82e579bd49d69845133c9aa8585f8bd26736437b,malicious DLL side-loaded by rastlsc.exe)
Depending on its privileges, the malware drops the files in %ProgramFiles% or %appdata%.
After achieving persistence and dropping the executable, the legitimate Symantec executable, rastlsc.exe, is executed using CreateProcessW.
If that file exists, it is decrypted using AES in CBC mode with a hardcoded, 256-bit key and then decompressed (LZMA compression).
We've also seen another version ({BB7BDEC9-B59D-492E-A4AF-4C7B1C9E646B}.dll), which executes rastlsc.exe with the parameter krv. Its meaning is discussed below.
If an IP address is resolved for this particular domain, then the malware tries to establish a connection on TCP port 25123. 
Each sample has three different domain names it can use to find its C&C server.
As mentioned earlier, the legitimate executable rastlsc.exe is dropped and executed.  
This executable imports the rastls.dll file, which in this case contains the malicious payload.
This export tries to read the SyLog.bin file located inside the same folder. Other versions tried to open the file OUTLFLTR.DAT. 
The shellcode decrypts and loads the library {E1E4CBED-5690-4749-819D-24FB660DF55F}.dll.
This DLL sends a POST request over the HTTP protocol to communicate.
If so, then a job is created and rastlsc.exe is executed again, but without the parameter.
The variant {92BA1818-0119-4F79-874E-E3BF79C355B8}.dll checks whether rastlsc.exe was executed with krv as the first parameter. 
The backdoor includes a PE loader that loads the library HTTPProv.dll in memory, calls its entry-point and then calls the export function named CreateInstance.
In order to retrieve the server IP address, the backdoor first creates a particular DNS query.
The latter is stored in the registry key as binary data: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\AppXc52346ec40fb4061ad96be0e6cb7d16a\DefaultIcon
Once its initialization is done, the following registry key is created to instruct the backdoor to use HTTP in future communication with the C&C server: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID{E3517E26-8E93-458D-A6DF-8030BC80528B}.
