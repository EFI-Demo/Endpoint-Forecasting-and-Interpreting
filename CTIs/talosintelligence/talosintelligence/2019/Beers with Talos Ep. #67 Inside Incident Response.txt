Recorded Nov. 21, 2019 

Craig is out sick/injured/fighting robots (actually all three), so we brought in Sean Mason from Talos IR to talk shop today and give you the inside scoop on IR (and Sean’s next-level beard care regimen). How do incidents affect the enterprise and consumers? How has the advent of widespread ransomware fundamentally shifted the burden of responsibility in the c-suite and what have been the outcomes? What does a responder have in the bag when they arrive on-site?



The timeline:

01:20 – Roundtable: Nigel heads to Anfield, show and tell with Joel, Matt wants Cats cosplay
12:08 – Meet Sean Mason, head of Talos IR group.
17:20 – Ransomware hand insurance have changed the conversation and shifted the burden for CISOs
22:45 – Being proactive BEFORE the incident even occurs: and being the steadiest hand when it does
30:40 – The moment Sean’s went wrong with “gif” - Tweet Craig for your chance at a Talos loot crate.
34:15 – The crew infiltrates Sean’s teams chat channel, and they deliver top-shelf questions for Sean from the worst incidents they have seen (and USB keys in the parking lot)  to the best headphones for travel
45:35 – Sean finally figures out Matt and Mitch are all up in his team chat
47:30 – Closing thoughts and parting shots
