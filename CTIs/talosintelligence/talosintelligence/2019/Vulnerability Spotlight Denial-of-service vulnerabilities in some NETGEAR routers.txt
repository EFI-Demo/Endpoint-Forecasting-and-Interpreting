Dave McDaniel of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities.

The NETGEAR N300 line of wireless routers contains two denial-of-service vulnerabilities. The N300 is a small and affordable wireless router that contains the basic features of a wireless router. An attacker could exploit these bugs by sending specific SOAP and HTTP requests to different functions of the router, causing it to crash entirely.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with NETGEAR to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
