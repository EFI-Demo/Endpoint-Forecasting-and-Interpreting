Ep. #43 show notes: 
Recorded Dec. 7, 2018.

Several of us are under the weather, but the show must go on. We did our best, as always. After running through some recent research, we spend a good bit of this EP looking through the lens of a recent breach at the first things a new security leader should get a handle on - what questions need to be answered? What information and practices are day-1 vital? We wrap up taking a look at a slew of vulns Talos uncovered in secure messaging apps.

The timeline:



The topics
01:00 - Roundtable - we talk about the Reds, death by IoT lawnmowers, and the special Spam we get
12:40 - DNSpionage campaign and DNS redirection attacks
20:50 - Day One as CISO - Handling Inherited Risk as a Leader
