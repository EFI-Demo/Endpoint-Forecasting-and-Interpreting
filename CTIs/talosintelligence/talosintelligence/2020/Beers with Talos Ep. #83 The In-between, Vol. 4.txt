Prod. Note: Things are a hot mess right now and the team thinks that there are voices you have needed to hear more than ours, so we held back on releasing a few episodes. We are releasing those now, please pardon any weeks-old info.  Be safe, be kind, and listen to each other.  Black lives matter. 

Sammi (inexplicably) continues tolerating out with the rest of the crew on The In-Between.  As usual, we avoid discussing security at all costs. These EPs are all about keeping in touch and catching up to chat. We talk about cool stuff we are watching to occupy our time and JOEL DID HIS ONE JOB! So, we are taking your (amazing) questions from Twitter.  Keep sending your questions for our regular episodes as well — @TalosSecurity #BWT.


 The timeline:

01:25 - Whatcha watchin? (See “ww” links below)
18:10 - Questions from Twitter. Holy crap. Joel did his job this week and wow, you all delivered.
