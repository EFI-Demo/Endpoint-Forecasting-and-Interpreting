		There are lots of great reasons to attend next week’s RSA conference in San Francisco. With keynotes by industry thought leaders and in-depth panel sessions with security experts, RSA is the seminal event for the cybersecurity industry and you’ll see many of us from Microsoft in attendance.
The cloud, of course, will be the focus of many discussions and the conference will show that the industry has made strong progress on cloud security along with roadmaps and information about what still needs to be done. Another strong theme I think we’ll see coming through is how to strategize for mobile devices and the consumerization of IT.
Perhaps you’re curious about what Scott Charney will be covering in his keynote, or who Tim Rains will be interviewing next for his Cloud Fundamentals video series. As for me, I’ll be backstage, meeting with reporters, talking to customers in the Microsoft booth and checking out the show floor, attending as many sessions  as possible and hanging out at a few of the evening events. Interesting and fun times ahead!
RSA is a good opportunity for Trustworthy Computing to listen to customers and learn from other industry experts and share what we have going on. You can find us in the pavilion hall and at a number of sessions sprinkled throughout the event. Here’s a rundown of these sessions:
