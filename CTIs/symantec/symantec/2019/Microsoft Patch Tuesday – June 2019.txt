As always, customers are advised to follow these security best practices:


	Install vendor patches as soon as they are available.
	Run all software with the least privileges required while still maintaining functionality.
	Avoid handling files from unknown or questionable sources.
	Never visit sites of unknown or questionable integrity.
	Block external access at the network perimeter to all key systems unless specific access is required.

An attacker can exploit this issue to gain the ability to downgrade NTLM security features. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to tamper with the NTLM exchange. The attacker could then modify flags of the NTLM packet without invalidating the signature.

	 

	Comctl32 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability   (CVE-2019-1043) MS Rating: Important
	A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that comctl32.dll handles objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker can exploit this issue to gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system.

	 

	Windows Network File System Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability   (CVE-2019-1045) MS Rating: Important
	A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Network File System (NFS) handles objects in memory. An attacker can exploit this issue to execute code with elevated permissions. To exploit the vulnerability, a locally authenticated attacker could run a specially crafted application.

	 

	Windows Shell Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability   (CVE-2019-1053) MS Rating: Important
	A privilege escalation vulnerability exists when the Windows Shell fails to validate folder shortcuts. An attacker can exploit this issue to elevate privileges by escaping a sandbox. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would require unprivileged execution on the victim system.

	 

	Windows Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability   (CVE-2019-1064) MS Rating: Important
	A privilege escalation vulnerability exists when Windows AppX Deployment Service (AppXSVC) improperly handles hard links. An attacker can exploit this issue to run processes in an elevated context. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.

	 

	Task Scheduler Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability   (CVE-2019-1069) MS Rating: Important
	A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the way the Task Scheduler Service validates certain file operations. An attacker can exploit this issue to gain elevated privileges on a victim system. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would require unprivileged code execution on a victim system.

	 
	
	
	Security Update for Skype for Business and Lync Server

	Skype for Business and Lync Server Denial of Service Vulnerability   (CVE-2019-1029) MS Rating: Important
	A denial of service vulnerability exists in Skype for Business. An attacker can exploit this issue to cause Skype for Business to stop responding. Note that the denial of service would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate the attacker's user rights.

	 
	
	
	Security Update for Azure

	Azure DevOps Server Spoofing Vulnerability   (CVE-2019-0996) MS Rating: Important
	A spoofing vulnerability exists in Azure DevOps Server when it improperly handles requests to authorize applications, resulting in a cross-site request forgery. An attacker can exploit this issue to bypass OAuth protections and register an application on behalf of the targeted user. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a page specifically designed to cause a cross-site request. The attacker would then need to convince a targeted user to click a link to the malicious page.
