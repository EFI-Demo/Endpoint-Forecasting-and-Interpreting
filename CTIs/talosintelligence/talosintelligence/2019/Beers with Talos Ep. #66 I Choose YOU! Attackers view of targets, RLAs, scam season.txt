Joel is out on PTO, so Mitch, Matt, Nigel, and Craig carry the banner this episode discussing how attackers approach targets like investors look at portfolios. We also talk about how the most recent off-cycle elections in the US give us a glimpse of improvements and changes in election security. Finally, we take a quick look at popular scams and how attackers use seasonality to increase the relevance of their scams for emotional responses. 


The timeline:

01:40 — Roundtable: Minds blown over planetary mechanics and the existence of Instapots.
14:15 —How attackers are looking at targets: defending from different attackers.
23:00 — Election security: A quick look at recent improvements and Mitch’s tin-foil hat.
33:40 — Welcome to scam season! How attackers use emotion to increase effectiveness.
41:40 — Closing thoughts and parting shots.
