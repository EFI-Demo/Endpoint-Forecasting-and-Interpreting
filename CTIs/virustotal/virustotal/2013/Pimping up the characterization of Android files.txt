Our resident Android expert, Anthony Desnos, is back from the Android jungle once again. In this new trip he has encountered and documented many new wild specimens, fought a couple of battles against nasty creatures such as SmsilenceÂ and worked hard to polish his main weapon when confronting and recognizing the evil: Androguard.

VirusTotal's private Androguard version has been noticeably improved and the information it dumps is far more extensive than it used to be, including a risk summary, permissions, permission-related api calls, activities, services, receivers, application certificate information and a very long etcetera. This new information appears under a new tab named file details, just as you can observe in the following screenshot.





This is just the very beginning of a series of new features that will hopefully improve your understanding of Android-related files, not only APKs but also DEX, ODEX and AXML formats, stay tuned! Meanwhile, you can take a look at a couple of reports with the new details:
