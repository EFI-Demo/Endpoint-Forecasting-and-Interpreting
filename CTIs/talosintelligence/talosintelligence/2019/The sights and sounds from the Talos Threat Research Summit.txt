More than 250 threat hunters, network defenders and analysts gathered ahead of Cisco Live for the second annual Talos Threat Research Summit on Sunday.

The conference by defenders, for defenders, returned this year after the inaugural event in 2018 to San Diego, where speakers passed on their knowledge of writing detection, stopping phishing attacks responding to ransomware, and more.

Liz Wharton, the vice president of operations and strategy at security firm Prevailion, kicked off the day with her keynote address, where she passed on her first-hand knowledge from handling a recent ransomware attack in Atlanta that took the city government offline for weeks.

Wharton discussed how governments and organizations can prepare ahead of time for these attacks, and what the appropriate responses are to these attackers.

We ended the day with a Q&A session with Talos leadership. Attendees asked about the appropriate responses to ransomware attacks, how we develop protections, and more. You can view to entire Q&A below.




Thanks to everyone who came out to this year's Threat Research Summit. We look forward to being back (and bigger) in 2020.
