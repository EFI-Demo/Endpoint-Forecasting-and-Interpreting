It’s hard to believe that we have made 100 episodes of BWT. It really feels like a lot more. This is a long-winded show, as we welcome back our buddy Nigel for this special milestone, complete with a Mighty Reds update. In an unintentional nod to our early episodes, the opening roundtable gets way off track. We basically host an “In-Between” episode in the middle of a regular show. Hopefully, our group therapy session on parenting through current events is beneficial listening to some. We also dig into supply chain attacks, in light of the recent SolarWinds incident, delving into defensive and IR strategies. Finally, we take a trip into the past remembering some of our favorite moments from the past 100 times I’ve written these show notes. The timeline:01:45 — Roundtable: We welcome back the Mighty Reds Update segment with Nigel08:00 — Off the path for a chat on modern parenting20:45 — Supply chain attacks and going beyond SolarWinds headlines53:00 — Some of our favorite moments from the first 100 episodes1:08:30 — Parting shots and closing thoughts The links:[blog] Your Pa$$word Doesn’t Matter [blog] It's Time to Hang Up on Phone Transports for Authentication==========Featuring: Craig Williams (@Security_Craig) and Matt Olney (@kpyke)Hosted by Mitch Neff (@MitchNeff)Subscribe via iTunes (and leave a review!)Check out the Talos Threat Research BlogSubscribe to the Threat Source newsletterFollow Talos on TwitterGive us your feedback and suggestions for topics: beerswithtalos@cisco.com
