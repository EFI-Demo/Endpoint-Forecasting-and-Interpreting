We start february welcoming AegisLab as a new file scanning engine working at VirusTotal. AegisLab was already collaborating with us with WebGuard in the URL scanning system. A description from the company about the engine:



"AegisLabâ€™s intelligent virus DNA algorithm extracts the special one-to-many mapping virus signatures. It achieved the much higher detection rate for latest Windows PE and Android APK variant virus. Their scan engine also uses the DNA fast match algorithm and is very suitable for limited resources environment. In native streaming mode, the engine is able to catch the most virus very efficiently from network packets."
