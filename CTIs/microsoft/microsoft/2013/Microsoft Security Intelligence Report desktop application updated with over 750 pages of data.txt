		A few months ago we launched the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (SIR) application that was designed to provide customers with an enhanced way to access the vast amount of threat intelligence contained in the SIR. The SIR app makes it easy to find, copy and share data from the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report. The SIR app runs on Windows 7 and Windows 8 based systems.
Based on all the positive customer feedback we received about the SIR app, today I am pleased to share that a new version of the SIR app is now available. The app includes over 750 pages of content from the latest SIR, volume 15.

You can download the app at http://aka.ms/GetSIRApp. We hope you find it useful and encourage you to provide feedback to our Twitter handle @MSFTSecurity.
