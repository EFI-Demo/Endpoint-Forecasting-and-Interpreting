I presented yesterday at the 9th annual Hackers2Hackers conference in Sao Paulo on the subject of information superiority, a subject the VRT has long been fond of. My slides are here for those who'd like to read them.

In a nutshell, the talk made the point that, if you know where to look, you can find almost everything you need to stay secure against any sort of threat on the Internet. A surprisingÂ  number of information sources are actually freely available on the Internet - even if you're not a security vendor - and many of these are listed in the presentation, so that anyone who's responsible for keeping a network secure can be using these sources.

After all, knowing is half the battle.
