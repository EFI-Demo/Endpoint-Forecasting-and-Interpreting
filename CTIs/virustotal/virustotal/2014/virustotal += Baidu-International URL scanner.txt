And we are in our sixties with respect to the number of URL scanning engines integrated in VirusTotal, welcome Baidu-International! Not so long ago we introduced their file scanner and today we are excited to populate the malicious URL dataset with their verdicts.

In their own words:

Baidu Antivirus is a permanently free and easy-to-use antivirus software which offers proactive defense, file protection, USB protection, download protection, browser protection, and other professional security features. 
As part of the browser protection component they offer they come across and have to research many malicious URLs per day, these URLs will now trigger alerts on VirusTotal. An example of their engine in action can be found below:
