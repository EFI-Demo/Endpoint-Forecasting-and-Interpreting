While increased dependence on technology is necessary for this transformation, and to position the business for success, it does pose risks from security threats. An organization cannot afford to wait until after users and systems have been compromised; it must be proactive.
It is impossible to be 100 percent secure. It can take less than 48 hours for attackers to gain complete control of a network,[1] and the median time to discover a breach is 99 days[2]. With incidents costing an average of $141 per lost or stolen record[3] and some cybersecurity events such as Petya costing $200-310 million[4], organizations must develop comprehensive risk management plans. These plans must keep a hybrid infrastructure resilient to a range of cyber threats encompassing both established and emerging threats. In addition, plans must help to manage the risk of emerging vulnerabilities, such as the recently disclosed processor vulnerabilities named “Spectre” and “Meltdown.”
Microsoft helps multiple global enterprises mitigate business impact by offering prescriptive guidance, as well as partnering with them to build a cyber resiliency plan and roadmap.
