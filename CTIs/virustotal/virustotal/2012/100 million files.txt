VirusTotal has reached a remarkable milestone today: 100 million files in it's database. That's more than most countries' population. Really amazing.Â But even more amazing is that more than 60 millions of those files have been submitted during last year, so we have grown in one year more than ever since VirusTotal's launch in 2004.

As our site grows the challenge is bigger, but we keep our commitment to give a useful service to all of you. And this is just the beginning, a lot more is coming!
