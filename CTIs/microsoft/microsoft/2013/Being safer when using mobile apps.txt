		From social networking to changing the channels on your TV, there are mobile apps for nearly everything you want to do. But when you install a mobile app, you need to exercise as much caution as when you download software for your computer.
No matter what kind of phone you have, install apps from a trusted source.
For a Windows Phone, you can only install apps from Marketplace. Doing so ensures that any app you install has been digitally signed, which helps reduce your risk and increase phone safety. A restrictive development policy is a major reason why the chief research officer of the security firm F-Secure gives the Windows Phone 8 mobile operating system a high security rating.
