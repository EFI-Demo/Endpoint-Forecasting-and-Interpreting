Recently a post by Crowdstrike was released detailing an attack being used, allegedly, by the Chinese Military "PLA Unit 61486". Â The post is a great demonstration of the use of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) to track an adversary in this increasingly digital world.

Naturally, we started receiving questions if we cover one of the malware/tools mentioned in the post:

(there are others like it)

The VRT can confirm that we've had coverage for the malware/tools mentioned here, since 2012. 

The Sourcefire IPS/Snort detects the outbound traffic with rules: 21240 and 21241, along with a similar variant at sid 21242.
