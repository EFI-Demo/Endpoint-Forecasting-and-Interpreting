When a vulnerability is released, regardless if it has a website and logo or not, we need to understand the risk to the network and what defense options are possible before the patch is ready for production. Can you defend against the vulnerability or do you go straight for known exploits? What happens if an exploit occurs? Also discussed: Talos begins releasing Threat Assessment Reports based on IR engagement data and known prevalent threats. Snort has a new series of training and lab video available for Snort 2 and Snort3.
