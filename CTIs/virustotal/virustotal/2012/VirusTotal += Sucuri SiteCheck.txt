It has been a while since we last added some new analyzer to our URL scanning engine, today we are excited to announce that Sucuri SiteCheck has become part of our small family. This is how the Sucuri team describes their service:


Sucuri SiteCheck is highly sophisticated and designed to identify a number of different malware types: Obfuscated JavaScript injections, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Website Defacements, Hidden & Malicious iFrames, PHP Mailers, Phishing Attempts, Malicious Redirects, Backdoors (e.g., C99, R57, Webshells), Anomalies, Drive-by-Downloads, IP Cloaking, Social Engineering Attacks. There are a number of blacklisting authorities that monitor for malware, SPAM, and phishing attempts. Sucuri SiteCheck leverages the APIs for the following authorities to alert you when you’ve been flagged: Sucuri, Google Safe Browsing, Norton, AVG, Phish Tank (Phishing Specifically), McAfee SiteAdvisor.

We are extremely grateful to Sucuri, you should now see them on our URL reports, just as an example:
