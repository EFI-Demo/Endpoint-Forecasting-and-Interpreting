		Are you sending your child back to school with a mobile phone, laptop, or tablet PC?
Director of Microsoft Trustworthy Computing Communications, Jacqueline Beauchere, offers these tips:

Set clear use limits for kids on their mobile phones.
Lock kids’ phones with a personal identification number (PIN), and keep the PIN secret—even from “best” friends.
Tell kids to avoid clicking links in advertisements, contest pages, text messages, or posts on social networking sites.
If you use a family location service to monitor your children’s whereabouts, make sure those outside the immediate family can’t locate them. Otherwise, consider disabling the location feature on the phone or, at the very least, turn off the feature in the phone’s camera.
