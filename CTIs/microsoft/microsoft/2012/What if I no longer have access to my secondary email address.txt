		Last week we answered a question about what to do if your Hotmail account is sending out spam. We mentioned resetting your password if you can’t sign in because your account has been blocked. One way you can unblock it is to respond to an email message sent by Microsoft to the secondary address you listed when you opened the account.
Many of you wrote in asking what to do if you no longer have access to that secondary email account. The answer: you will need to fill out a support request. (In fact, now would be a good time to make sure that your secondary address is correct.)
Even better, you can associate your Hotmail account with your mobile phone number or other information that hackers cannot easily access. For example, if you lose your password or your account is hacked, Hotmail sends you an account-recapture code in a text message to help you regain access.


You can also set up a “trusted PC”—associate your Hotmail account with one or more of your personal computers. If you need to reset your password to regain control of your account and you use a trusted PC, Hotmail will know you are the legitimate owner.
