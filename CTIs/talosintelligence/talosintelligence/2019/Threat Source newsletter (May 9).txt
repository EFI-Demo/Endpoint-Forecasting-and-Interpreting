Newsletter compiled by Jonathan Munshaw.

Welcome to this week’s Threat Source newsletter — the perfect place to get caught up on all things Talos from the past week.

If you haven’t yet, there’s still time to register for this year’s Talos Threat Research Summit — our second annual conference by defenders, for defenders. This year’s Summit will take place on June 9 in San Diego — the same day Cisco Live kicks off in the same city. We sold out last year, so hurry to register!

This was a heavy week for vulnerability discovery. Snort rules are loaded up with protections against a recent wave of attacks centered around a critical Oracle WebLogic bug. We also discovered vulnerabilities in SQLite and three different Jenkins plugins.

Finally, we also have our weekly Threat Roundup, which you can find on the blog every Friday afternoon. There, we go over the most prominent threats we’ve seen (and blocked) over the past week.

Upcoming public engagements with Talos


Event: Copenhagen Cybercrime Conference

Location: Industriens Hus, Copenhagen, Denmark

Date: May 29

Speaker: Paul Rascagnères

Synopsis: Paul will give an overview of an espionage campaign targeting the Middle East that we called “DNSpionage.” First, he will go over the malware and its targets and then talk about the process the attackers took to direct DNSs. The talk will include a timeline of all events in this attack, including an alert from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.


Event: Bsides London

Location: ILEC Conference Centre, London, England

Date: June 5

Speaker: Paul Rascagnères

Synopsis: Privacy has become a more public issue over time with the advent of instant messaging and social media. Secure Instant Messaging (SIM) has even become a problem for governments to start worrying about. While many people are using these messaging apps, it’s opened up the door for attackers to create phony, malicious apps that claim to offer the same services. In this talk, Paul will show various examples of these cloned applications and the different techniques used to send data back to the attacker. 



Cyber Security Week in Review



The city of Baltimore’s online government operations were completely stalled this week after a ransomware attack. The city’s IT director said the RobinHood malware forced the government to go “manual” with many tasks. Emergency services have not been impacted.
A group of hackers stole information from three American antivirus companies. The group is offering source code and network access to the companies for $300,000. The companies affected have not been named yet but were recently contacted by the federal government to alert them of the breach.
Attackers stole $41 million worth of Bitcoin from cryptocurrency exchange Binance. A representative from Binance said hackers used a variety of techniques, “including phishing, viruses and other attacks.”
The tax services of Danish mega company Wolters Kluwer were taken offline this week as the result of a cyber attack. The outage specifically affected CCH, a cloud-based company, that caused “network and service interruptions.”
WordPress’ latest update includes a few long-awaited security updates. Each of the content management system’s updates will now include digital signatures, and there is a new “Site Health” page for users.
Google’s latest security update fixed a number of vulnerabilities in the Android operating system, including several critical- and high-severity bugs. The most notable fix is for a vulnerability in Media framework that could “enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.”
Cisco released security updates for a critical vulnerability in the Elastic Services Controller. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain admin privileges. 
Israel bombed the cyber headquarters of Hamas in retaliation for an alleged cyber attack. Military involvement, in this case, has brought up several questions surrounding how cyber warfare could begin intersecting with physical retaliation.
A power supplier on the West Coast was hit with a cyberattack last week. The attack did not cause any loss of power for customers but did prevent visibility in some parts of the country. 
Cyber firms are increasingly turning to non-traditional sources of recruiting as the industry looks to fill a talent gap. Some companies are training researchers on the go, even if they do not have a traditional security degree.


Notable recent security issues


Title: Attacks using WebLogic bugs expand, evolve
Description: Attackers continue to spread malware by exploiting a critical vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic. The bug, identified as CVE-2019-2725, was disclosed and patched last week. However, as users have been slow to update, attackers are still able to exploit this vulnerability to deliver ransomware, specifically Gandcrab and XMRig.

Snort SIDs: 50014 - 50025


Title: Cisco discloses 41 bugs, one of them critical
Description: Cisco released a security update for several of its products, including one critical bug in the SSH key management for the Nexus 9000 series Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode switch software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to a machine via SSH, which could allow them to connect to the system with the same privileges as a root user.
Snort SIDs: 49992 - 49996, 50006, 50007
