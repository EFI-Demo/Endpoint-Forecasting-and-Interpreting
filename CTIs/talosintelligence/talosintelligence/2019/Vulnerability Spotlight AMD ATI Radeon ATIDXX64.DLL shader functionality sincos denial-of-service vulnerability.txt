Cisco Talos recently discovered a denial-of-service vulnerability in a specific dll inside of the AMD ATI Radeon line of video cards. This vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a malformed pixel shader inside a VMware guest operating system. Such an attack can be triggered from VMware guest usermode to cause an out-of-bounds memory read on vmware-vmx.exe process on host, or theoretically through WEBGL.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with AMD to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
