		A reader asks:
“I recently received a package from UPS. This Overnight Air envelope contained three postal money orders for $820.00.
I called the UPS number on the envelope and spoke to someone about tracking the envelope and found out it was a scam. Whoever sent it believed that I would deposit the money orders into my bank. It’s always wise to check when in doubt. 
Has this happened to anyone else?”
Thanks for writing. We’re glad that you recognized this scam. We haven’t seen this one in particular, but we do often see a related UPS phishing scam that involves an email attachment that could contain a virus or other unwanted software.
