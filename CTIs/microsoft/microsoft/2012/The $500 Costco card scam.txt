		Many respondents to a recent Microsoft survey expressed concern about trickier scams that are happening on social networks. The Microsoft Malware Protection Center recently blogged about one of these new scams that claims to offer a free Costco gift card to all Facebook users.
But donâ€™t click the link. If you want to see what would happen if you clicked it and followed the instructions, read A Facebook scam, end to end.
If you see any kind of offer that looks too good to be true, it probably is. Always check the official company or product website to see if it mentions the offer.
