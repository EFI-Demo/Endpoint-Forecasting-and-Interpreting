It's been more than seven years since Google acquired VirusTotal, and more than one year since we moved to Chronicle. Today we have another update: Chronicle is joining Google Cloud. This update, like our move to Google a few years back, does not change the mission or focus of VirusTotal. We'll continue to operate independently, focused on our mission of helping keep you safe on the web.
