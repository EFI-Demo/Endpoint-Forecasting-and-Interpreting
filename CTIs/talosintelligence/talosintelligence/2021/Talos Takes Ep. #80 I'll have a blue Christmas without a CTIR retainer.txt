Oh, and it's never a bad time to brush up on your Incident Response Plan or grab a Cisco Talos Incident Response retainer. Attackers are always stepping up their game this time of year, as we discussed a few weeks ago. And the New Year is as good a time as any to look over your organization's policies and plans. Brad Garnett joins the show this week to discuss the recent acknowledgments CTIR received, so after he gets his victory lap out of the way, we talk about lessons learned from 2021 and how supply chain issues should influence your IR plans heading into the new year. Apple Podcasts Spotify  Stitcher
