The first episodes of Beers with Talos are now available on iTunes and directly on talosintelligence.com/podcasts.






When Talos decided to make a threat intelligence podcast, we wanted to make it different than your typical buttoned down, subdued security podcast.  The BWT crew: Craig, Joel, Nigel, and Mitch, decided to do that by making a podcast that is a lot like the discussions that you would have after work with colleagues - if your colleagues were both ridiculously opinionated and hyper-focused on security research. Occasionally we’ll even have some special guests join us. 

At its core, Beers with Talos is four people from Talos unpacking some of the biggest recent security stories from various perspectives and making (terrible) jokes the whole time.  It doesn’t matter if you are a grizzled SOC vet, a researcher, an executive, or you just want to stay informed about the threat landscape, everyone can take something away with them at the end of an episode. Check out the episodes we have released and let us know what you think and what topics you might want to hear covered or guest you would like us to invite for future episodes.

You can listen and subscribe on iTunes (or directly to our RSS feed if that’s your style).  We would love to hear your feedback and ideas for future episodes - tweet @TalosSecurity using #BWT or you can email us at BeersWithTalos@cisco.com.
