  Newsletter compiled by Jon Munshaw.Good afternoon, Talos readers.  In case you missed the Friday news drop last week, we have an update on the Lemon Duck cryptocurrency miner. It's not as eye-catching as the ransomware attacks that make the news, but Lemon Duck's exploitation of Microsoft Exchange servers shows that patching is still king, and a cryptocurrency attack shows there's room for additional attacks in the future.Speaking of patching, it's time to update your Microsoft products if you haven't already. This month's Patch Tuesday included a wormable vulnerability in the HTTP protocol stack that has a severity score of 9.8 out of 10. Of course, it's important to always patch any and all vulnerabilities, but that's the one that most people came out of Tuesday talking about.Upcoming public engagements with TalosTitle: Cisco Secure at RSA 2021Date: May 17 - 20Overview: Come visit Cisco's booth virtually at the RSA Conference 2021.

There are only three critical vulnerabilities patched in this month, while two are of “moderate” severity and the rest are “important.” All three critical vulnerabilities, however, are considered "more likely” to be exploited, according to Microsoft.  This month’s security update provides patches for several major pieces of software, including Microsoft Office, SharePoint and Windows’ wireless networking. The most serious vulnerability exists in the HTTP protocol stack. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit CVE-2021-31166 by sending a specially crafted packet to a targeted server utilizing the stack. If successful, the adversary could gain the ability to execute remote code on the targeted server. According to Microsoft, the vulnerability is wormable and the company “recommends prioritizing the patching of affected servers.” It has a CVSS severity score of 9.8 out of 10. Snort SIDs: 57539, 57540, 57542 – 57545, 57548 - 57550 Title: Cisco discloses critical vulnerabilities that expose corporate networks   Description: Cisco recently patched three critical security vulnerabilities between the SD-WAN vManage software and the HyperFlex HX platform. These vulnerabilities, if left unpatched, could allow an attacker to completely take over corporate networks that are using this software. vManage is a network management system that allows users to monitor and configure any devices and links they have in the broader SD-WAN. The most serious vulnerability in this group is CVE-2021-1468, which has a CVSS severity score of 9.8 out of 10. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a specially crafted input to the service, eventually allowing them to call privileged actions on the affected systems. The adversary could then also create new administrative-level accounts. Snort SIDs: 57527 – 57530, 57535 - 57538 Most prevalent malware files this weekSHA 256: c1d5a585fce188423d31df3ea806272f3daa5eb989e18e9ecf3d94b97b965f8eMD5: 9a4b7b0849a274f6f7ac13c7577daad8 Typical Filename: ww31.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: W32.GenericKD:Attribute.24ch.1201SHA 256: e3eeaee0af4b549eae4447fa20cfe205e8d56beecf43cf14a11bf3e86ae6e8bd MD5: 8193b63313019b614d5be721c538486b Typical Filename: SAService.exe Claimed Product: SAService Detection Name: PUA.Win.Dropper.Segurazo::95.sbx.tg SHA 256: 8b4216a7c50599b11241876ada8ae6f07b48f1abe6590c2440004ea4db5becc9 MD5: 34560233e751b7e95f155b6f61e7419a Typical Filename: SAntivirusService.exe Claimed Product: A n t i v i r u s S e r v i c e Detection Name: PUA.Win.Dropper.Segurazo::tpd SHA 256: 85b936960fbe5100c170b777e1647ce9f0f01e3ab9742dfc23f37cb0825b30b5MD5: 8c80dd97c37525927c1e549cb59bcbf3Typical Filename: svchost.exeClaimed Product: N/A Detection Name: Win.Exploit.Shadowbrokers::5A5226262.auto.talosSHA 256: 5e46ecffcff9440e97bf4f0a85ad34132407f925b27a8759f5a01de5ea4da6af MD5: 0a13d106fa3997a0c911edd5aa0e147a Typical Filename: mg20201223-1.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: RanumBot::mURLin::W32.5E46ECFFCF.in12.Talos Keep up with all things Talos by following us on Twitter. Snort, ClamAV and Immunet also have their own accounts you can follow to keep up with their latest updates.
