Recorded April 3, 2020

We’re kinda bored. We figured you are too. So we decided to get together between normal recordings to help save you from the bottom of the Netflix barrel. It gets weird down there. These Quittin’ Time episodes are just the crew hanging out for a bit without a security topic agenda. None of that. Honestly, if you’re not a fan of the banter in the Roundtable and Closing Thoughts segments, this probably isn’t your cup of tea. Anyway, we have fun getting together and feeling more normal for a bit, we hope you have fun listening to the heavily edited version of that. Send us your questions for the next time we do a podcast like this — @TalosSecurity #BWT.
