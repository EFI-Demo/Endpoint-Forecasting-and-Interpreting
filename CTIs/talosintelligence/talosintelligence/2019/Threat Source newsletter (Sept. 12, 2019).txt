Newsletter compiled by Jon Munshaw.

Welcome to this week’s Threat Source newsletter — the perfect place to get caught up on all things Talos from the past week.

You’ve heard it a million times: Always patch. But in case you needed another example that it’s important, Cisco Incident Response took a deep dive into a recent wave of Watchbog infections they observed. In this post, IR breaks down why this infection occurred, and what you can learn from it. 

Speaking of patching, it’s as good of a time as any to update all of your Microsoft products. The company released its latest security update as part of their monthly Patch Tuesday. Check out our breakdown of the most important vulnerabilities here and our Snort coverage here.

Ever considered an “illustrious career in cybercrime?” Well, don’t do it. So says Craig on the latest Beers with Talos podcast where the guys talking about “hacking back” and Matt’s level of Twitter fame.

We also have our weekly Threat Roundup, which you can find on the blog every Friday afternoon. There, we go over the most prominent threats we’ve seen (and blocked) over the past week.



Upcoming public engagements with Talos
Event: “DNS on Fire” at Virus Bulletin 2019
Location: Novotel London West hotel, London, U.K.
Date: Oct. 2 - 4
Speaker: Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres
Synopsis: In this talk, Paul and Warren will walk through two campaigns Talos discovered targeted DNS. The first actor developed a piece of malware, named “DNSpionage,” targeting several government agencies in the Middle East, as well as an airline. During the research process for DNSpionage, we also discovered an effort to redirect DNSs from the targets and discovered some registered SSL certificates for them. The talk will go through the two actors’ tactics, techniques and procedures and the makeup of their targets.
Event: “It’s never DNS...It was DNS: How adversaries are abusing network blind spots” at SecTor
Location: Metro Toronto Convention Center, Toronto, Canada
Date: Oct. 7 - 10
Speaker: Edmund Brumaghin and Earl Carter
Synopsis: While DNS is one of the most commonly used network protocols in most corporate networks, many organizations don’t give it the same level of scrutiny as other network protocols present in their environments. DNS has become increasingly attractive to both red teams and malicious attackers alike to easily subvert otherwise solid security architectures. This presentation will provide several technical breakdowns of real-world attacks that have been seen leveraging DNS for a variety of purposes such as DNSMessenger, DNSpionage, and more.

Cyber Security Week in Review



Some states’ departments of motor vehicles are selling driver’s license data to private companies, including private investigators. Many individuals registering for licenses do not read data agreements that allow states to turn around and sell their personal information. 
Some Chromebooks mistakenly alerted users that the devices were reaching their end-of-life. A small number of brand new devices, after a reboot, told the user to upgrade to newer hardware to receive the latest security update. Google has since fixed this bug. 
A new report outlines the first recorded cyber attack on the U.S. power grid. North American Electric Reliability Corp. says it lost visibility into a small portion of its grid due to a “cyber event” in March. 
The popular Wikipedia site went down across Europe and the Middle East due to a series of denial-of-service attacks. The actor behind the DDoS kept up their efforts for about three days. 
The U.S. filed criminal charges against a professor in Texas for allegedly stealing information on behalf of Chinese tech company Huawei. The same person had already been named in a civil suit surrounding these claims. 
Apple’s reputation as having the most secure mobile operating system has taken a hit over the past few weeks due to multiple vulnerabilities being disclosed. Security researchers say the company may have put too much faith into its own code in iOS and the Safari web browser.  
New emails show that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency was close to purchasing malware from Israel’s controversial NSO group. But the agreement was eventually called off due to the high cost. 
UNICEF, a well-known non-profit organization, mistakenly leaked the personal data of more than 8,000 users who had accessed its online portal. The non-profit sent the information in an email to 20,000 users, after which they disabled the portal for a short time. 
A now-closed payroll processing firm withdrew millions of dollars from some New Yorkers’ bank accounts — and the CEO is nowhere to be found. MyPayrollHR alerted customers two weeks ago that it would be shutting down, and this week took back a month’s worth of pay from employees who worked for those customers.

Snort SIDs: 51436 - 51438, 51445, 51446, 51449 - 51452, 51454 - 51457, 51463 - 51465, 51479 – 51483

Title: Some NETGEAR routers vulnerable to DoS attacks  
Description: The NETGEAR N300 line of wireless routers contains two denial-of-service vulnerabilities. The N300 is a small and affordable wireless router that contains the basic features of a wireless router. An attacker could exploit these bugs by sending specific SOAP and HTTP requests to different functions of the router, causing it to crash entirely.
