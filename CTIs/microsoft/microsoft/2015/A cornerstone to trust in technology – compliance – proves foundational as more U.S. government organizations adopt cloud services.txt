		Government agencies want the economic benefits of cloud computing, but this alone isn’t always enough to make the case for change. To move forward, decision makers want to understand the security, privacy and compliance commitments of their cloud service provider. We continue to track and complete a number of attestations and compliance certifications, confirming controls are in place that help enable cloud solutions for government organizations. And, while compliance represents a necessary set of requirements for many governments prior to Cloud adoption, customers also tell us that these investments are helping increase IT security and are therefore integral to decision-making.
One recent example in the United States, is the Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS), a division of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that operates systems to provide state, local, and federal law enforcement, and criminal justice agencies, with access to criminal justice information. In April, the California Department of Justice confirmed that Microsoft Azure Government cloud solutions complied with CJIS standards for handling criminal justice information in the cloud. In addition to the State of California, Microsoft has signed CJIS agreements for Office 365, Azure, or Dynamics CRM Online in 11 states, including Texas, Michigan, Kansas, and Pennsylvania, and more are still to come.
For U.S. government entities who want to learn more about the cloud in general, and the cloud services available today, I encourage a visit to our dedicated site.
Obtaining new certifications or updating current ones can be a complicated task. Whether CJIS requirements, FedRAMP, IRS 1075, or HIPAA, organizations rely on their cloud service provider to adhere to these requirements as well as provide the tools necessary to confirm compliance. If you’re interesting in learning more about what we’re doing in the area of compliance, the Azure Trust Center, the Office 365 Trust Center and the Dynamics CRM Trust Center all provide summary level and detailed information.
