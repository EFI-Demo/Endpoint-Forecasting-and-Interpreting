Recorded April 26, 2019 - Since Craig decided to skip the podcast today, we decided to invite one of Austin’s top actual security experts, Wendy Nather, to stop by. After Mitch is done being a fanboy, Wendy breaks down zero-trust, beyond the marketing story of a world without a perimeter. We spend most of the time discussing what zero trust looks like as a security model and how it can be implemented in the real world. We also dive into usability and “good enough” security. 

The timeline:

1:20 — Roundtable: Craig is playing hooky, Wendy finds two acres of lost data centers
9:00 — Meet Wendy Nather, head of advisory CISOs at Cisco Duo. She has three times more Twitter followers than Craig.
17:00 — What exactly does zero-trust actually mean?
36:00 — Why we can’t have nice things, like banana bread?
50:30 — Closing thoughts, parting shots
