Talos went wall-to-wall at Hacker Summer Camp, showing up to Black Hat and DEFCON with talks, challenges, advice and education.



Over the course of two days at Black Hat, Cisco Security hosted more than 20 talks at our booth, many featuring Talos researchers and analysts.



In case you couldn't swing by the booth, we've got a quick recap of eight of those "flash talks" to give you a quick rundown of what our researchers wanted to get across. Click on each of these videos to hear each speaker give a quick recap, and stay tuned for a future Beers with Talos episode to hear all of them together.
