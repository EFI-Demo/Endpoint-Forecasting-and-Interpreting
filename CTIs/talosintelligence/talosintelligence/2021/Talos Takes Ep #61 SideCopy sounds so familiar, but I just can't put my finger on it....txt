APT 36, aka Transparent Tribe, was recently discovered adding new tools to attack Windows machines. Another, similar group called "Sidewinder," also went after targets on the Indian subcontinent.Now, he's following the SideCopy APT, which takes the best of both worlds and borrows heavily from Transparent Tribe and Sidewinder. Asheer joins Talos Takes this week to discuss his research into SideWinder and break down the recent research paper he co-authored on the group. We discuss SideCopy's "borrowing" of other group's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and the active development of several trojans they use. Apple Podcasts Spotify  Stitcher
