		You’re probably already aware that a deadly cyclone hit the southeast Asian country of Myanmar in early May. What you may not know is that criminals have set up fake donation sites in order to scam generous donors who want to help.


 

This fraud is known as phishing. Pronounced “fishing,” this is a type of online identity theft that uses e-mail and also fraudulent Web sites that are designed to steal your personal data or information such as credit card numbers, passwords, account data, or other information.  


 

For more information on how to help protect yourself from donation phishing scams, see Want to help? Take care to avoid online donation scams. 


 

Safer ways to donate


 

Microsoft has encouraged employees who wish to donate to give through partner international humanitarian relief organizations, such as CARE, World Vision, The American Red Cross, or Save the Children. Microsoft has also partnered with NetHope — a nonprofit IT consortium of leading international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) — to provide technology resources and support as needed.
