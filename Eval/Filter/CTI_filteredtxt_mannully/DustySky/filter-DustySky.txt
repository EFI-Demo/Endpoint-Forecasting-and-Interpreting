The archive contains an .exe file, sometimes disguised as a Microsoft Word file, a video, or another file format, using the corresponding icon. 
The attackers would usually send a malicious email message that either links to an archive file (RAR or ZIP compressed) or has one attached to it.
Upon execution of the malicious version (2f452e90c2f9b914543847ba2b431b9a) the legitimate iMazing is installed, while in the background 
When linked from the malicious message, the malware would be hosted either on a cloud service (many times in copy.com, a legitimate file hosting service), or on a server controlled by the attackers.Phishing 
If the victim extracts the archive and clicks the .exe file, the lure document or video are presented while the computer is being infected with DustySky.
DustySky is dropped as a file named Plugin.exe (1d9612a869ad929bd4dd16131ddb133a), and executed: Plugin.exe immediately starts communicating with its command and control sever using the hardcoded address ns.suppoit[.]xyz and supo.mefound[.]com, both also pointing to above mentioned 45.32.13.169.
In recent samples, fake invoices and a copy of the public Google privacy policy were used.
After infecting the computer, the attackers used both the capabilities of DustySky, and those of public hacking tools they had subsequently downloaded to the computer.
After the victim fills in and sends the fake login form, they are redirected to a legitimate website.
IP address 45.32.13.169 and all the domains that are pointing to it8 host a webpage which is a copy of a legitimate and unrelated software website - iMazing, an iOS management software.
Plugin.exe immediately starts communicating with its command and control sever using the hardcoded address ns.suppoit[.In the posting, the attackers claim they are looking for someone to build “an application like that this website [sic]” and entice the viewer to “download application and take an overlook [sic]” from imazing[.This behavior deviates from the attackers’ usual pattern of sending malicious email to selected (albeit many) individuals.
In one case, the attackers used stolen email credentials and logged in from 96.44.156.201, potentially their proxy or VPN endpoint.
DustySky Core is dropped to %TEMP% and runs using either cmd or the .NET interface. 
Keylogging logs are saved to %TEMP%\temps . 
They also logged in from 5.101.140.118 , an IP address that belongs to a proxy service called privatetunnel.com (in previous incidents, emails were sent from a nearby address - 5.101.140.114).
Once sure the computer is not a VM, it extracts, runs and adds persistency to DustySky Core.
The dropper uses the following function to obfuscate the name of functions and other parts of the malware (In later versions, SmartAssembly 6.9.0.114 .NET obfuscator was used):
The malware would also scan the computer for files that contain certain keywords.Abusing breached email account
For VM evasion the dropper checks whether there is a DLL that indicate that the malware is running in a virtual machine (vboxmrxnp.dll and vmbusres.dll which indicate vitualbox and vmGuestlib.dll which indicates vmware). 
One is the lure document (internally called "news"), which is presented to the victim once the dropper is executed. 
When ordered by the command and control server, the keylogger is extracted and executed.
On that day, the actors seem to remove the registered domain and strictly use dynamic DNS.
If the dropper is indeed running in a virtual machine, it will open the lure document and stop its activity:
It communicates with the command and control server, exfiltrates collected data, information and files, and receives and executes commands.
They took screenshots and a list of active processes in the computer, and sent them to their command and control severs.
The files are uploaded via a POST request to a URL that ends with key.php.
Some of the malicious email messages, for example those containing “Supermodel Bar Refaeli Stars in Israeli Spy Movie.exe” and “ חמאס חשף תיעוד של גלעד שליט מהשבי .exe” (Hamas unveiled a documentation of Gilad Shalit in captivity), were sent from 185.12.187.10515 and 31.223.186.7116 respectively.
The dropper uses Windows Management Instrumentation11 to extract information about the operating system and whether an antivirus is active.
