Ep. #34 show notes: 
Recorded July 20, 2018 — This week, we touch on several topics, but we spend the lion’s share of the episode discussing the mobile device management (MDM) campaign we've been following. We are joined by Aaron Woland and spend a great deal of time discussing how these attacks work and how they happen to users of devices across multiple platforms. We talk about the differences in how MDM is handled across different OS flavors, and the similarities in how the attacks happen (hint: users ignoring the warnings).

The timeline:
