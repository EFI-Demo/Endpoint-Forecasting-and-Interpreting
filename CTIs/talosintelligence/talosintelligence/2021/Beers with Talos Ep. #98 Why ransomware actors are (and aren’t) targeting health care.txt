We’re happy to put this one out now with somewhat belated takes on (somewhat recent) health care ransomware attacks. We discuss a few key questions that are rather evergreen. Why is health care targeted in this way (and other verticals for that matter)? What defines a “high value” target to a ransomware actor? How can targeted entities better defend themselves? The timeline:01:30 — Roundtable: Feel that end-of-year burn...07:20 — Ransomware heating up  in health care and government organizations11:40 — How actors see potential targets16:30 — Defense for health care organizations22:00 — Closing thoughts, parting shots The links:Voter suppression in U.S. elections (GoodReads link)==========Featuring: Craig Williams (@Security_Craig) and Matt Olney (@kpyke)Hosted by Mitch Neff (@MitchNeff)Subscribe via iTunes (and leave a review!)Check out the Talos Threat Research BlogSubscribe to the Threat Source newsletterFollow Talos on TwitterGive us your feedback and suggestions for topics: beerswithtalos@cisco.com
