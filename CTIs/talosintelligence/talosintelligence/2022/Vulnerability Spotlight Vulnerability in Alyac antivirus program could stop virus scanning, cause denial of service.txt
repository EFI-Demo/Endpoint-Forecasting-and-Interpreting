Jaewon Min of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities. Blog by Jon Munshaw. Cisco Talos recently discovered an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the ESTsecurity Corp.’s Alyac antivirus software that could cause a denial-of-service condition.  If successful, an attacker could trigger this vulnerability to stop the program from scanning for malware, which would be crucial in a potential attack scenario. Alyac is an antivirus software developed for Microsoft Windows machines.  TALOS-2022-1452 (CVE-2022-21147) is a vulnerability that exists in a specific Alyac module that, eventually, leads to a crash of Alyac’s scanning process, which effectively neutralizes the antivirus scan. Cisco Talos worked with ESTsecurity to ensure that this issue is resolved and an update is available for affected customers, all in adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. Users are encouraged to update these affected products as soon as possible: ESTsoft Alyac, version 2.5.7.7. Talos tested and confirmed this version is affected by this vulnerability. The following SNORTⓇ rules will detect exploitation attempts against this vulnerability: 59014 and 59015. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center or Snort.org.
