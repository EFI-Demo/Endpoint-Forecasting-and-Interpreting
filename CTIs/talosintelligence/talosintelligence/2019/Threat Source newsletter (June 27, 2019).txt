Welcome to this week’s Threat Source newsletter — the perfect place to get caught up on all things Talos from the past week.

You never want to fall behind on Beers with Talos. So make sure to listen to the latest episode on your commute home today. This episode — featuring special guest and Talos Threat Research Summit keynote speaker Liz Wharton — was recorded live in San Diego as part of Cisco Live. So yes, there’s audience participation, and no, you are not prepared for it.

We also have our weekly Threat Roundup, which you can find on the blog every Friday afternoon. There, we go over the most prominent threats we’ve seen (and blocked) over the past week.

Upcoming public engagements with Talos

Event: “It’s never DNS...It was DNS: How adversaries are abusing network blind spots” at SecTor
Location: Metro Toronto Convention Center, Toronto, Canada
Date: Oct. 7 - 10
Speaker: Edmund Brumaghin and Earl Carter
Synopsis: While DNS is one of the most commonly used network protocols in most corporate networks, many organizations don’t give it the same level of scrutiny as other network protocols present in their environments. DNS has become increasingly attractive to both red teams and malicious attackers alike to easily subvert otherwise solid security architectures. This presentation will provide several technical breakdowns of real-world attacks that have been seen leveraging DNS for a variety of purposes such as DNSMessenger, DNSpionage, and more. 

Cyber Security Week in Review



For the second time this month, a Florida city agreed to pay roughly half a million dollars to the hackers behind a ransomware attack. The government of Lake City, Florida agreed to pay $460,000 in exchange for the return of its email services and several servers attackers had seized. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned American users of an uptick in wiper attacks originating from Iran. The advisory came as military tensions continue to rise between the two countries. 
Dell warned of a critical vulnerability in its pre-installed SupportAssist software on millions of its PCs. The bug could allow an attacker to trick the machine into running a malicious DLL file. 
Hackers stole roughly $4.2 million worth of cryptocurrency from Sigaporean exchange Bitrue. The attackers exploited a vulnerability in the exchange’s site and accessed the personal funds of 90 users. 
Attackers tracked roughly 20 global officials with ties to China by infiltrating 10 cellphone carriers’ networks. A recent report states the attackers stole text messages, location data and call logs. 
The head of the U.S. House Homeland Security cyber subcommittee says he will introduce a bill to create two new security grants. Both funds would grant money to state and local governments to prepare for cyber attacks and secure election technology. 
The European Union plans to run new military exercises to plan for potential major cyber attacks from Russia and China.  


Notable recent security issues


Title: Netwire malware delivered through Firefox vulnerability  
Description: Attackers are exploiting a now-patched Mozilla Firefox vulnerability to deliver the Netwire malware. At the time of first exploitation, there was no fix for the bug. Netwire uses two separate functions to persist — once as a launch agent and again as a login item. New Snort rules prevent the malware from downloading its final payload.
Snort SIDs: 50498, 50500

Title: Cisco patches critical bugs in DNA Center, SD-WAN  
Description: Cisco has patched a slew of critical and high-severity flaws in its DNA Center and SD-WAN. In all, the company issued fixes for 25 vulnerabilities last week across a variety of its products. Two of the most severe bugs exist on access ports necessary for Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center. There is another critical vulnerability in SD-WAN's command line interface.
Snort SIDs: 50467, 50469 – 50472, 50485 – 50489, 50492
