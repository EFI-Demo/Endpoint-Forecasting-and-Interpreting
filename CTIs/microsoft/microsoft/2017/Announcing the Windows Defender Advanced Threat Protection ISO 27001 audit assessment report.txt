		The security and privacy of customer data are our top priority. Our goals are simple: to operate our services with the security and privacy you expect from Microsoft, and to give you accurate assurances about our security and privacy practices.
In line with our commitment to provide customers the utmost transparency, we have enhanced auditing around Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) information security and privacy controls. We asked independent third-party auditors to test and assess Windows Defender ATP against the ISO 27001 standards.
We are excited to announce that Windows Defender ATP achieved ISO 27001 certification. You can now find the Windows Defender ATP 27001 audit assessment report in the compliance reports section on the Trust Center ISO 27001 certification page.
To test how Windows Defender ATP can help your organization detect, investigate, and respond to advance attacks, sign up for a free trial.
