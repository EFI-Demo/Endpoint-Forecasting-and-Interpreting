One of the main focuses of this version of the report is the ongoing threat of the Conficker worm, which threatens businesses and large organizations who use weak passwords or do not install updates to their systems.
Over the next month we’ll explore the Conficker threat and other highlights from the SIR, including how to avoid scareware and how you can prevent unwanted software with free tools from Microsoft.
