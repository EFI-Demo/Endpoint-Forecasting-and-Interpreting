Ep. #38 show notes: 
Recorded Sept. 21, 2018 — The whole crew is back together! On the agenda today is VPNFilter part III, now with more known third-stage payloads. As much as we have talked about multi-part posts, you know we wouldn’t post if it wasn’t important (on the blog, that is. That rule obviously doesn’t apply here). We are also releasing a related open-source tool: Winbox Protocol Dissector. Finally, we delve into an antivirus-avoiding remote access tool (RAT).

The timeline:



The topics
01:20 — Roundtable: Matt’s stories, Craig breaks things and himself, you know… the usual.
11:25 — VPNFilter 3: New research unearths a new batch of third-stage modules.
26:18 — Defense in depth, jump off from an antivirus-avoiding DDE malware.
33:40 — Closing thoughts and parting shots.
