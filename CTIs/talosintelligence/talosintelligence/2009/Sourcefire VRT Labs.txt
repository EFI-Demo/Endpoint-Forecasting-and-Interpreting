We are opening the Sourcefire VRT Labs for business. We've had a few useful things floating around in the jungle for a while now and we decided to make everything available, in one place, for everyone to use. Right now, Labs has a few resources on it we thought folks might find useful, such as Brian's Shared Object Rule Generator, Lurene's AWBO exercises and PE-Sig (also written by Brian).We have a lot more material and tools to add over the coming months and shortly, we will start a series of blog posts on using the SO rule generation tool which will walk you through using the tool and what to do with the source code that gets generated. We hope you will find it useful and hopefully, you will more easily be able to write your own custom detection SO rules.We would also welcome your input on the site and what content you would like to see on there.You can find it here: http://labs.snort.org/ and when the SO rule blog posts start in January we will be announcing the official availability of the site via the Snort mailing lists. Stay tuned, there is a lot more to come.
