The VRT is announcing the discovery and patching of 4 CVE vulnerabilities
in Pidgin. These vulnerabilities were discovered by the VRT VULNDEV team and
reported to the Pidgin team. The VRT also created TRUFFLE rules that
have been protecting Sourcefire customers for these vulnerabilities since October 1st 2013, while the Pidgin team was working on patching them. TRUFFLE rules provide a way for the VRT to release cutting edge coverage
 without exposing threats to the public through a plaintext rule. We are releasing these rules publicly as part of our update today, since the Pidgin team is releasing Pidgin 2.10.8 that addresses these issues. It is available for download here: http://www.pidgin.im/
