We welcome the Symantec Mobile Insight scanner to VirusTotal. This engine is specialized in Android and reinforces the participation of Symantec that already had a multi-platform scanner in our service. In the words of the company:


"Symantec Mobile Insight is a comprehensive mobile security service capable of identifying suspicious and malicious apps using a broad array of endpoint-based and cloud-hosted techniques. These techniques blend traditional code and behavior analysis with cutting edge similarity and machine learning applications. Leveraging analysis of over 50 million apps and telemetry from millions of endpoints on a daily basis, we're able to provide superior protection. Our App Advisor technology can help end users identify malware and other unwanted apps on the App Store, prior to installation.‚Äù

Symantec has expressed its commitment to follow the recommendations of AMTSO and, in compliance with our policy, facilitates this review by AV-TEST, an AMTSO-member tester.
