		The Internet
Explorer 9 beta protects against 99 percent of “socially engineered malware,”
according to independent researcher NSS Labs.
What is socially engineered malware?
Cybercriminals use socially
engineered malware to gain access to your computer. According to NSS Labs,
socially engineered malware describes any link that leads to malicious websites
or downloads that could harm your computer.
Research shows that these links
appear on popular websites and services such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn
as cybercriminals are increasingly taking advantage of people’s trust in these
sites.
How Internet Explorer 9 protects against socially engineered malware
NSS Labs says that the success of
Internet Explorer in blocking this kind of malware can be credited to SmartScreen
URL filtering (included in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9) and
SmartScreen application reputation (new to Internet Explorer 9).
Here’s how Internet Explorer 9
stacks up against other web browsers when it comes to blocking this kind of
malware.
