		Last week we told you about how to avoid
fake donation websites and emails if you want to help Japanese earthquake
and tsunami victims.
Eweek
reports that cybercriminals have also started using Japanese earthquake
related search terms to lead people to their malicious websites. These
fraudulent websites show up in search results of people looking for news and
information about the earthquake. If you click on these sites, you might be
infected with software that could steal your personal information or might make
your computer display fake
virus alerts that trick you into paying for a fraudulent product or
service.
Here are two free ways to help protect you against these
fraudulent search results:


Download
and install Internet Explorer 9, which includes the SmartScreen Filter to
help protect you against fraudulent websites.

Download and install
Microsoft Security Essentials to help protect against viruses, spyware, and
other malicious software.
