The first Microsoft Update Tuesday of 2014 is here and it’s
a very light month this time around. We’ve got 4 bulletins covering 6 CVEs.
What’s remarkable is that there’s no Internet Explorer bulletin this month. There are also no bulletins
that are marked critical, all 4 bulletins are marked as important.



The first bulletin, MS14-001, is for Word and Office Web Apps,
this bulletin covers 3 CVEs (CVE-2014-0258, CVE-2014-0259 and CVE-2014-0260.  They are memory corruption vulnerabilities in Word, which could result in
remote code execution. 



MS14-002 is a fix for the Windows XP/2003 0-day kernel escalation
of privilege vulnerability (CVE-2013-5065) that was being exploited in the wild
in tandem with the Adobe Reader vulnerability (CVE-2013-3346). Here an attacker
would convince the user to open a maliciously crafted PDF that would exploit the use
after free in Adobe Reader to gain code execution. Once that was done, the
malicious code would exploit a vulnerability in the NDProxy driver, where an
out of bounds access to a table of function pointers would attempt to execute
code in userland, which allows an attacker to gain system privileges.



The next bulletin MS14-003 provides another fix for a kernel
mode driver vulnerability that could allow an attacker to gain elevated
privileges by exploiting a vulnerability in win32k.sys (CVE-2014-0262).



The final bulletin (MS14-004) fixes a denial of service
vulnerability (CVE-2014-0261) in Microsoft Dynamics AX. 



We’re releasing rules SID 28867-28872 to address these
issues.
