We welcome SecureAge APEX scanner to VirusTotal. In the words of the company: 


“SecureAge APEX is an anti-malware scanning engine powered by artificial intelligence, designed to extend the detection capabilities of the SecureAge SecureAPlus endpoint protection platform (EPP). The APEX engine provides next-generation endpoint detection as part of the SecureAPlus layered approach to security which includes Application Control & Application Whitelisting, multi-cloud anti-virus, fileless attack protection and more. To deal with advanced threats like zero-day malware, the APEX engine goes beyond traditional scanners by reliably identifying unseen and mutated malware types and variants from day one of their release. The APEX engine that runs in VirusTotal targets Windows PE files; with integration into the VirusTotal ecosystem, SecureAge looks forward to further enhancing APEX's capabilities, and above that, adding value to VirusTotal's cybersecurity services.”

SecureAge has expressed its commitment to follow the recommendations of AMTSO and, in compliance with our policy, facilitates this review by AV-Comparatives, an AMTSO-member tester.
