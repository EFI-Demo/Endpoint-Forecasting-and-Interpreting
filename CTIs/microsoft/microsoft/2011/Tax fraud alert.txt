		It’s tax time in the United States again. Whether you’re
filing online or off, it’s good to be careful with your personal and financial
information.
Here are some ways you can help protect yourself from online
tax scams:


Recognize.
There are thousands of different kinds of scams. The IRS website states that
they do not initiate communication with people via email. If you receive an
email that appears to be from the IRS, it is probably a scam. Also, if you get
an offer from someone that sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. For
more information, see the IRS article, Tax
Scams – How to Recognize and Avoid Them. 

Ignore.
Never respond to unsolicited emails. If an email looks suspicious, don’t
respond. And definitely don’t open any
attachments.

Report.
If you think you might have been a victim of a scam, you can report it to phishing@irs.gov.

protect yourself, see Protect your personal information! The IRS
does not initiate taxpayer communications through email.
