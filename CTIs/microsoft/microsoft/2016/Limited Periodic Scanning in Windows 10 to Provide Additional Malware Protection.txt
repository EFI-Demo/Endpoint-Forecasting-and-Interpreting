		Every month, Microsoft’s Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) scans more than 500 million Windows devices for malware and malicious software. This tool aids in the detection and removal of malware from 1 to 2 million machines each time, even on those devices running antivirus software. Meanwhile, many Windows customers continue to use the Microsoft Safety Scanner (MSS) to manually scan their PC for malware.
Windows 10 is the most secure operating system Microsoft has ever shipped, and we continue to make it better with regular security updates and new features. For example, we’re making malware detection and protection even easier and more seamless for our customers, whether they choose to use the built-in Windows Defender antivirus or a third-party antivirus solution. Starting with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update this summer—and available in this week’s Windows Insider build—Windows 10 will include a new security setting called Limited Periodic Scanning. Windows Insiders can enable this feature on unmanaged devices today.
When enabled, Windows 10 will use the Windows Defender scanning engine to periodically scan your PC for threats and remediate them. These periodic scans will utilize Automatic Maintenance—to ensure the system chooses optimal times based on minimal impact to the user, PC performance, and energy efficiency—or customers can schedule these scans. Limited Periodic Scanning is intended to offer an additional line of defense to your existing antivirus program’s real-time protection.
 
Enabling Windows 10 Limited Periodic Scanning 
If you are not using Windows Defender as your antivirus program on Windows 10, you can enable Limited Periodic Scanning under Settings.

Navigate to Settings -> Update & Security -> Windows Defender.
Turn Limited Periodic Scanning on.


If you are already using Windows Defender as your antivirus program on Windows 10, then you already have this feature enabled. Windows Defender periodically scans your PC, also known as Scheduled scans.
 
Notifying you of threats found on your PC
When Windows 10 Limited Periodic Scanning is turned ON, and even if you are NOT using Windows Defender for your real-time protection, the Windows Defender user interface and History tab will allow you to view any additional threats that have been detected.
 
When a threat is found, Windows Defender will notify you with a Windows 10 notification. In most cases, Windows Defender will also automatically take action on the threat. Clicking on the notification will open Windows Defender where you can further review the threat that was found and the action that was automatically taken.

Clicking the notification will take you to the Windows Defender main user interface, where additional actions (if required) can be taken and applied.
At this time, Windows 10 Limited Periodic Scanning is intended for consumers. We are evaluating this feature for commercial customers, but Limited Periodic Scanning only applies to unmanaged devices for the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.
Windows 10 is our most secure operating system yet, and we will continue to improve Windows 10 with features like Limited Periodic Scanning. With Windows 10, you can rest assured you’ll always have the latest security protections. To learn more about the security features offered in Windows 10 visit: http://www.microsoft.com/security.
