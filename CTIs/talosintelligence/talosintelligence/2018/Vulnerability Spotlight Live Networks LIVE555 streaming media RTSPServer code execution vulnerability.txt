Cisco Talos is disclosing a code execution vulnerability that has been identified in Live Networks LIVE555 streaming media RTSPServer.

LIVE555 Streaming Media is a set of open-source C++ libraries developed by Live Networks Inc. for multimedia streaming. The libraries support open standards such as RTP/RTCP and RTSP for streaming, and can also manage video RTP payload formats such as H.264, H.265, MPEG, VP8, and DV, and audio RTP payload formats such as MPEG, AAC, AMR, AC-3 and Vorbis. It is used internally by well-known software such as VLC and MPlayer.

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the HTTP packet-parsing functionality of the LIVE555 RTSP server library, which is not part of media players, but interacts with them. A specially crafted packet can cause a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker can send a packet to trigger this vulnerability. 




Vulnerability details

TALOS-2018-0684 describes the vulnerability CVE-2018-4013. The LIVE555 Media Libraries are a lightweight set of multimedia streaming libraries for RTSP/RTCP/RTSP/SIP, with code support for both servers and clients. They are utilized by popular media players such as VLC and MPlayer, as well as a multitude of embedded devices (mainly cameras). 

One of the functionalities enabled by LIVE555 for their standard RTSP server is the ability to tunnel RTSP over HTTP, which is served by a different port bound by the server, typically TCP 80, 8000, or 8080, depending on what ports are available on the host machine. This port can support normal RTSP, but in certain cases, the HTTP client can negotiate the RTSP-over-HTTP tunnel.

The vulnerability exists in the function that parses HTTP headers for tunneling RTSP over HTTP. An attacker may create a packet containing multiple "Accept:" or "x-sessioncookie" strings which could cause a stack buffer overflow in the function "lookForHeader."


Affected software

The vulnerability is confirmed in Live Networks LIVE555 Media Server, version 0.92 but it may also be present in the earlier version of the product.
