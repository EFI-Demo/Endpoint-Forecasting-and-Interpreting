		Cybercriminals use social engineering to prey on our weaknesses. Sometimes they take advantage of our goodwill towards others, like in the “I’ve been mugged scam” I wrote about in a recent blog post. More often they try to trick us with deals that seem too good to be true. 
Cybercriminals can also sneak software (called “ransomware”) onto your computer. This will pop up a window warning that illegal material has been found on your computer, and lock you out of your computer unless you pay a fee. We’ve been reporting on this kind of scam at least as far back as 2008, but the Microsoft Malware Protection Center recently blogged about its resurgence in several languages, including English, Spanish, German, and Dutch.
Get more information about this scam from the Microsoft Malware Protection Center blog.
