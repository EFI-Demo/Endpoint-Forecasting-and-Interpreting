		Several readers have contacted us lately about suspicious text messages that they’ve received on their smart phones.
Some of these messages appear to be from Microsoft, Starbucks, Best Buy, or other well-known companies and are designed to trick you into clicking links with lures of free gifts or prizes. If you click these links you could be taken to a malicious website that could automatically download malicious software onto your phone. This could cause damage to your phone or could be used to steal your personal information or remotely control your phone.
Don’t click links in text messages unless you know the sender and are expecting the link.
