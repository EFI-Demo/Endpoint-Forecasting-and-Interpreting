Ep. #45 show notes: 
Recorded Jan. 18, 2019

We have an extended roundtable today (even more than usual) because we accidentally discussed some relevant security topics in the meantime. Eventually, we move on to talk about recent releases, primarily the PyLocky decryptor and more internet-of-things vulnerabilities. We move on to discuss what’s going on in the small and home office device space, with some specific advice and a lot of rage. This episode closes out discussing the release of a new plugin for IDA called "Dynamic Data Resolver" (download available) and reminding everyone of the TTRS CFP (closing soon!) here.

The timeline:
