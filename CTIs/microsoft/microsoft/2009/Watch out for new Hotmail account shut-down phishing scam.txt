		We’ve recently heard about a new phishing scam that targets Windows Live Hotmail users.  If you see an e-mail message that looks like the one below, do not respond. Delete it or click Junk to mark the sender as unsafe and delete the message. 

The most important clue that this is a phishing scam is the request for personal information. The Windows Live team does not request passwords, user names, or other personal information via e-mail.
