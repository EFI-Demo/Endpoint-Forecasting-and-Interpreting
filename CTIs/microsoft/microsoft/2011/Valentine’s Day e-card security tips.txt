		Electronic greeting cards are easy, cheap, and fun to get
and send, but cybercriminals also use them to try to steal your personal
information or to spread malicious software.
Legitimate companies have standard, obvious ways for you to
recognize that the email is not a fraud. For example, with MSN Greetings, the
“from” line always shows “Ecard from MSN Greetings” as the
display name and “ecards@msn.americangreetings.com”
as the email address.

scams that target activities, interests, or news events.
