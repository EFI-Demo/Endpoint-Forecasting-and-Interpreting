		You can use your smartphone and location services (also known as “geolocation”) to post information about where you are at any given time. But before you use geolocation, you might want to consider these safety tips:

Share your location only with people you trust. For example, in a service like Facebook Places, create a separate list of your closest friends. Use privacy controls to restrict access to location status updates, messages, and photos to those people who are on your list.
Disable the option that allows others to share your location.
Set your location data so that it’s not publicly available or searchable.
