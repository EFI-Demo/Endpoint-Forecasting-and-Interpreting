		Weâ€™ve seen an increase in scam email messages that promise recipients they have won some kind of prize or a lottery. These unsolicited messages will often claim that the prize is sponsored by Microsoft or another well-known company. They request personal information that cybercriminals can use for identity theft.
Do not respond to these fraudulent messages with personal information. There is no Microsoft Lottery.
