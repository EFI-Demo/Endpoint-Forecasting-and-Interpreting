# Endpoint Forecasting and Interpreting (EFI)
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks have caused significant damage worldwide. Various Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems are deployed by enterprises to fight against potential threats. However, EDR suffers from a high number of false positives. In order not to affect normal operations, analysts need to investigate and filter detection results before taking countermeasures, in which heavy manual labor and alarm fatigue cause analysts miss optimal response time, thereby leading to information leakage and destruction. To this end, we propose Endpoint Forecasting and Interpreting (EFI), a real-time attack forecast and interpretation system, which can automatically predict next move during post-exploitation and explain it in technique-level, then dispatch strategies to EDR for advance reinforcement. First, we use CTI reports to extract the attack scene graph (ASG) that can be mapped to low-level system logs to strengthen attack samples. Second, we build a serialized graph forecast model, and combine the attack provenance graph (APG) created by EDR to generate an attack forecast graph (AFG) to predict the next post-exploitation attack. Finally, we combine the attack template graph (ATG) and graph alignment plus algorithm for technique-level interpretation to automatically dispatch strategies for EDR to reinforce system in advance. EFI can avoid the impact of existing EDR false positives, and can reduce the attack surface of system without affecting the normal operations. We collect a total of 3,483 CTI reports, generate 1,911 ASGs, and manually construct 256 ATGs. The experimental results show that the forecast and interpretation precision of EFI can reach 91.8%.
