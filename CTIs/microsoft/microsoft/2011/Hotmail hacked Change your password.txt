		We received this email message from a reader:
“My Hotmail account keeps getting hacked and my
contacts are getting a message from me requesting money. I had gotten two [email
messages] from Microsoft asking me to confirm my Hotmail account with my password.
It happened twice and I thought it was authentic. I am thinking that it was a
scam.”
This is a scam. Microsoft does not send
unsolicited email asking for your Hotmail password. You should not send
passwords, user names, or other sensitive information in an email message.
For more information about these kinds of scams, see Avoid scams
that use the Microsoft name fraudulently.
What should you do?
If you still have access to your account, you should change
your Hotmail password. Use our
password checker to make sure your new password is strong.
For more information and to find out what to do if you no
longer have access to your account, see Recent
reports of account hijacks.
