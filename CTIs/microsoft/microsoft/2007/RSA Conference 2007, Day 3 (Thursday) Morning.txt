		I went to some really good sessions yesterday, among them “the Buzz on Fuzzing” by Hugh Thompson, who had a great definition for what fuzz testing is, which I caught on video and will be posting as an update whenever I have some free time.  I did not catch his excellent description of his first experience with fuzz testing Coke machines on the video, and if can’t get him to tell the story for me again today, I may just resort to describing it in text ;-0
 Mike Howard and I are presenting today on Windows Vista security changes in the developer track, so please come to that if you are at the show, and introduce yourself if we haven’t met.  Here are the other Microsoft sessions today:
