We welcome Zoner antivirus as a new file scanning engine at VirusTotal. In the words of the company:



"Zoner AntiVirus is a relative newcomer to the anti-virus community, having previously created an Android protection app.

It is currently focusing on current threats and leaving some old ones for later (like old win95, bootsector viruses, etc.).

The whole engine and x86 emulator are being created in-house."
