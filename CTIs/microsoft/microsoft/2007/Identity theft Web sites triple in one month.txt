		According to a report by the Anti-Phishing Working Group, the number of recorded phishing sites nearly tripled between March and April of 2007.  

Phishing is a type of fraud that uses e-mail and fake Web sites to trick you into giving away sensitive personal or financial information. The Anti-Phishing Working Group reports that Web sites of financial institutions, in particular large US banks, are the most spoofed Web sites.

Here are three steps you can take to help protect against phishing and other forms of ID theft:

1.       Install the Microsoft Phishing Filter to help block fraudulent Web sites as you surf the Internet. 

2.       If you think you’ve received a phishing e-mail message, delete it and do not respond.

3.       Don’t click links in e-mail messages. Links in phishing e-mail messages often take you to phony sites that encourage you to enter personal or financial information that con artists then collect and use.
