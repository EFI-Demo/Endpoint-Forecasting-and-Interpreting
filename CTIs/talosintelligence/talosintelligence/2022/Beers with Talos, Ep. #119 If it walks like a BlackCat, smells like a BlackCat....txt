But we still wanted to check back in and update our listeners on the malware we're seeing in the wild in Ukraine and discuss President Biden's recent warning that state-sponsored actors could soon target U.S. critical infrastructure.On the non-Ukraine front, we also are joined by special guest Nick Biasini from the Talos Outreach team to talk about the BlackCat ransomware group. BlackCat seemingly has some ties to BlackMatter/DarkSide (infamous for the Colonial Pipeline attack) but is there any formal connection? Turns out, ransomware groups work more like a real business than you'd think.   The timeline:01:45 — Roundtable: Bragging about Talos' cool swag10:40 — Potential connections between BlackCat and BlackMatter14:11 — Current wiper malware we're seeing target Ukraine22:40 — How Talos Incident Response is working with Ukrainian customers25:50 — Parting shots, closing thoughts: The occult side of eBayThe links:From BlackMatter to BlackCat: Analyzing two attacks from one affiliateThreat Advisory: CaddyWiperVideo shows red truck driving through tornado in central TexasPlaying piano for strangers on Omegle==========Featuring: Liz Waddell (@vlsin), Nick Biasini (@infosec_nick) and Matt Olney (@kpyke).Hosted by Mitch Neff (@MitchNeff).Subscribe via iTunes (and leave a review!)Check out the Talos Threat Research BlogSubscribe to the Threat Source newsletterFollow Talos on Twitter and InstagramGive us your feedback and suggestions for topics: beerswithtalos@cisco.com
