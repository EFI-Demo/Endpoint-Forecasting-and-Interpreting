		We recently received this email message from a reader:
“I got a call from someone who said that he was from ‘Windows
Technical Department Support Group.’ He said he was calling to fix my security
system. He wanted me to log onto a website so he could walk me through a
process that would give him access to my computer so he could ‘get rid of a
virus and fix it.’ When I started asking where he was and what he intended to
do, he hung up on me.” 
This is a scam. If you receive a phone call like this, hang
up.
Cybercriminals have been calling people on the telephone,
claiming to be from Windows or from Microsoft, and offering to help solve their
computer problems. Once cybercriminals have gained your trust, they can:

Trick you
     into installing malicious software on your computer.
Take
     control of your computer remotely and adjust settings in order to leave
     the computer vulnerable.
Request
     credit card information so that they can bill you for the phony services.
