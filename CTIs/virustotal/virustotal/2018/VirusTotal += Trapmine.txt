We welcome Trapmine scanner to VirusTotal. In the words of the company: 


“Trapmine ThreatScore is a machine learning-powered malware detection engine developed to identify known and never-before-seen malware. This engine is a part of TRAPMINE Endpoint Detection & Protection Platform. Trapmine combines machine learning, behavior monitoring and endpoint deception techniques to provide fool-proof defense against malware, exploit attempts, file-less malware, ransomware and other forms of targeted attacks. Windows PE files submitted to VirusTotal will be analyzed by Trapmine ML engine and the verdicts will be displayed to VirusTotal users.”

Trapmine has expressed its commitment to follow the recommendations of AMTSO and, in compliance with our policy, facilitates this review by MRG Effitas, an AMTSO-member tester.
