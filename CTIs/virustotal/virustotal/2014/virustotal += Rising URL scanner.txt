Rising antivirus has been running in virustotal for quite some time, today we are excited to announce the integration of their URL scanner, which will be enhancing virustotal's web checking backbone.

Hopefully this integration will lead to a greater coverage of threats targeting Chinese end-users. This is an example of a Rising detection:
