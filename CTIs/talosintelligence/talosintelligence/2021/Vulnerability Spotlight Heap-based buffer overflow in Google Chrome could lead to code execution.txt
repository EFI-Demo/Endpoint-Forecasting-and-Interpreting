Marcin “Icewall” Noga of Cisco Talos discovered this vulnerability. Blog by Jon Munshaw. Cisco Talos recently discovered an exploitable heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Google Chrome.  Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser — and Chromium is the open-source version of the browser that other software developers use to build their browsers, as well. TALOS-2021-1235 (CVE-2021-21160) is a buffer overflow vulnerability in Chrome’s AudioDelay function that could allow an adversary to execute remote code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted HTML page in Chrome. Proper heap grooming can give the attacker full control of this heap overflow vulnerability, and as a result, could allow it to be turned into arbitrary code execution. Cisco Talos worked with Google to ensure that this issue is resolved and an update is available for affected customers, all in adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. Users are encouraged to update these affected products as soon as possible: Google Chrome, versions 841401 (89.0.4383.0, 64-bit) and 844161 (90.0.4390.0, 64-bit). Talos tested and confirmed these versions of Chrome could be exploited by this vulnerability. The following SNORTⓇ rules will detect exploitation attempts against this vulnerability: 57057 and 57058. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Firepower Management Center or Snort.org.
