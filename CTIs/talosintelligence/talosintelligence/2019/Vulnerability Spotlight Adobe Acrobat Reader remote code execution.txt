Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities.

Executive summary
There is a remote code execution vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat Reader that could occur if a user were to open a malicious PDF on their machine using the software. Acrobat is the most widely used PDF reader on the market, making the potential target base for these bugs fairly large. The program supports embedded JavaScript code in the PDF to allow for interactive PDF forms, giving the potential attacker the ability to precisely control memory layout and creating an additional attack surface.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with Adobe to ensure that the issue is resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
