		One of the tools I get asked most about when I’m with customers is the Enhanced Mitigations Experience Toolkit (EMET). EMET is a free mitigation tool designed to help IT Professionals and developers prevent vulnerabilities in software from being successfully exploited. The tool works by protecting applications via the latest security mitigation technologies built into Windows, even in cases where the developer of the application didn’t opt to do this themselves. By doing so, it enables a wide variety of software to be made significantly more resistant to exploitation – even against zero day vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities for which an update has not yet been applied.
You can download this new version of EMET here.
For more information on this new version, I encourage you to visit the Security Research and Defense blog.
