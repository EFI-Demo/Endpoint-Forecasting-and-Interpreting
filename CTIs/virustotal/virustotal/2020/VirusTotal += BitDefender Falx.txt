 We welcome the BitDefender Falx scanner to VirusTotal. This engine is specialized in Android and reinforces the participation of Bitdefender that already had two engines in our service, their multi-platform scanner (BitDefender) and a 100% machine learning engine (BitDefenderTheta). In the words of the company:“Bitdefender offers a cloud-based malware detection product for Android. It is built on several automated systems that perform different methods of static and dynamic analysis. Powerful machine learning models and other complex threat detection techniques form a state of the art security solution capable of detecting previously-unseen advanced malware. The cloud-based approach offloads computationally intensive tasks to a distributed cloud environment to deliver the best protection with no impact on system or battery performance.”Bitdefender has expressed its commitment to follow the recommendations of AMTSO and, in compliance with our policy, facilitates this review by AV-Comparatives, an AMTSO-member tester.
