Linux.Encoder.1 has earned a reputation as the world’s first ransomware family tailored for Linux platforms. After thwarting the massive ransomware infection with the release of a free decryption tool, Bitdefender researchers looked into a number of reports in which the tool was unable to decrypt the data.
A closer look revealed these files had been encrypted with an older variant of the Ransomware Trojan, which means hackers had been in the Linux ransomware business long before the discovery of Linux.Encoder.1.
We dubbed this “first draft” of this ransomware Trojan Linux.Encoder.0. However, lacking a sample file to analyze the way keys and IVs were generated, our decryption endeavors had to rely on diff-ing normal and encrypted files, blind reverse engineering and gut feelings. Our research into the way crypto was built into Linux.Encoder’s predecessor is documented in a paper (click for direct download) by Radu Caragea, Vulnerability Researcher and cryptography expert at Bitdefender..
