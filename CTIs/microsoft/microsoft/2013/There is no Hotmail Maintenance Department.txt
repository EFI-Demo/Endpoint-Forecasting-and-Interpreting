I received an email from the Hotmail Maintenance Department requesting personal information verification. The message included a PDF file. Is this a scam?
Yes. This is one of many types of email cybercrime, also called phishing. Cybercriminals often use the Microsoft name to try to get you to share your personal information so that they can use it for identity theft. Delete the message—do not open it, and do not click any links or open any attachments.
The Hotmail Maintenance Department doesn’t exist—and if it did, the department wouldn’t send unsolicited email messages with attachments that asked for your personal information. Be suspicious of any email messages that appear to come from the Hotmail team; even though your email address still says “Hotmail,” the service is now called Outlook.com.

If you opened the PDF file, your computer might already be infected with malware that can be used to steal your personal information. Scan your computer with the Microsoft Safety Scanner to find out. The scanner will also help you remove any malicious software it finds.
