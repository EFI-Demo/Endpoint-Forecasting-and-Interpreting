You read it here first, folks. Bitdefender is now officially an ITU partner.  ITU-IMPACT is the cybersecurity executing arm of the United Nations’ specialised agency – the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). As the world’s first comprehensive alliance against cyber threats, IMPACT brings together governments, academia and industry experts to enhance the global community’s capabilities in dealing with cyber threats.
Bitdefender has joined the alliance to further contribute to the global effort against cybercrime, more specifically by participating in threat information exchange and capacity building programs, with an emphasis on providing advance threat warning and vulnerability data.
