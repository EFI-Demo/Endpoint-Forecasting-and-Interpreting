		The cloud is a network of computers on the Internet—a “cloud” of computers—on which data, including yours, can be stored. When you check your email or the news, or pay bills or play a game online, you’re often accessing the cloud. Some of your personal information is also in the cloud if you store files there.
Storing files in the cloud is particularly useful if you’re collaborating on a school or work project. You can use a service like Microsoft SkyDrive to save your files in the cloud so you don’t have to manage multiple versions. These types of services make it easy for everyone who is working on the project to access the files, work on them, and save them back to the same place.
Because the data is in the cloud, you can access it from (and share it between) your phone or computer or any other device connected to the Internet. Whatever cloud service you use, make sure you understand how the service helps protect your privacy. For example, learn about how SkyDrive helps protect your privacy.
