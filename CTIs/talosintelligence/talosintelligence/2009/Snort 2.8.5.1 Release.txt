Hot on the heels of the Snort 2.8.5 release, a new Snort tarball is now available that fixes a few issues:Fixed syslog output when running on Windows.Fixed potential segfault when printing IPv6 packets using the -v option. Thanks to Laurent Gaffie for reporting this issue.Fixed segfault when additional policies were added during a configuration reload.There's nothing particularly pressing with any of these issues, but as always you should download and install now.
