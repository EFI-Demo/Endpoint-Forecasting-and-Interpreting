		Have you ever received an email or seen a warning page on a website claiming that legal authorities had detected illegal activities on your computer?
This scam infects your computer with a type of malicious software called “ransomware.” The aim of ransomware is to prevent you from using your computer until you pay a fee (the “ransom”). If you see an email or a warning like this, do not follow the payment instructions.
Some ransomware will lock your computer so you can’t use the Internet to get help. But you might be able to fix the problem if you have another computer with a clean operating system and Internet access. You can use it to download Windows Defender Offline onto removable media and then run the recovery tool on your computer.
