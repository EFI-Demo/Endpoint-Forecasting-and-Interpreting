The advisory states that, "a vulnerability was discovered under Pulse Connect Secure (PCS). This includes an authentication by-pass vulnerability that can allow an unauthenticated user to perform remote arbitrary file execution on the Pulse Connect Secure gateway. This vulnerability has a critical CVSS score and poses a significant risk to your deployment." The company released a blog post alongside this advisory disclosing that the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency also released an alert warning of these vulnerabilities. In the alert, CISA notes that networks belonging to multiple government agencies, critical infrastructure entities and private sector organizations have been compromised going as far back as June 2020. Snort SIDs: 51288, 51289, 51390, 57452 – 57459 and 57461 - 57468 Title: Targets still seeing a rise in COVID-19-themed malware campaignsDescription: A new report indicates that the amount of malware campaigns using COVID-19-themed lures continue to rise, even more than a year after the pandemic took hold in the U.S. New data shows that COVID-related cyber attack detections rose by 240 percent in the third quarter of 2020 and 114 percent in Q4. Many attackers relied on privilege escalation techniques to spread ransomware and other threats off the backs of these campaigns. Some used PowerShell, while others relied on remote access trojans like Remcos. Several state-sponsored actors have also been involved in these attacks. Snort SIDs: 57431 Most prevalent malware files this weekSHA 256: c1d5a585fce188423d31df3ea806272f3daa5eb989e18e9ecf3d94b97b965f8eMD5: 9a4b7b0849a274f6f7ac13c7577daad8 Typical Filename: ww31.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: W32.GenericKD:Attribute.24ch.1201SHA 256: e3eeaee0af4b549eae4447fa20cfe205e8d56beecf43cf14a11bf3e86ae6e8bd MD5: 8193b63313019b614d5be721c538486b Typical Filename: SAService.exe Claimed Product: SAService Detection Name: PUA.Win.Dropper.Segurazo::95.sbx.tg SHA 256: 3bc24c618151b74ebffb9fbdaf89569fadcce6682584088fde222685079f7bb9 MD5: d709ea22945c98782dc69e996a98d643 Typical Filename: FlashHelperService.exe Claimed Product: Flash Helper Service Detection Name: W32.Auto:3bc24c6181.in03.Talos SHA 256: 85b936960fbe5100c170b777e1647ce9f0f01e3ab9742dfc23f37cb0825b30b5MD5: 8c80dd97c37525927c1e549cb59bcbf3Typical Filename: svchost.exeClaimed Product: N/A Detection Name: Win.Exploit.Shadowbrokers::5A5226262.auto.talosSHA 256: 17c4a85cdc339f525196d7f5da3a02e43c97513ff50b6bc17db4470ae3b182e2  MD5: 96f8e4e2d643568cf242ff40d537cd85 Typical Filename: SAService.exe  Claimed Product: SAService  Detection Name: PUA.Win.File.Segurazo::95.sbx.tg Keep up with all things Talos by following us on Twitter. Snort, ClamAV and Immunet also have their own accounts you can follow to keep up with their latest updates.
