Mark this phrase – “trusted supply chain.”  It is not in Wikipedia yet, but it is an important discussion point for managing cybersecurity and risk that looks at the question of where your software came from and who touched it before it was deployed on your platforms.  There were a few stories this week and go directly to this issue in a way that people have personally experienced.

Rethinking Cyber Threat.  It is not just about cybercrime anymore.  I’m continuing to see what I consider a “good thing” with respect to news coverage of cyber threat – not treating it all as “cybercrime.”  That doesn’t mean everybody agrees on the definition of Cyber War yet either, as emphasized recently in the panel discussion at RSA 2011 between Chertoff, Schneier, and Michael McConnell.
