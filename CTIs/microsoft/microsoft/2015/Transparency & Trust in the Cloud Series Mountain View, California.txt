Thank-you very much to all the customers that made time to join us at the Microsoft campus in Mountain View, California! This was another very well attended event with numerous large enterprise customers located in the vicinity in attendance.
Like all the Transparency and Trust events prior to this one, I learned from the attendees what their expectations are for a Cloud Service Provider when it comes to security, privacy and compliance. We had several lively discussions on a range of topics. These are some of the themes that emerged during our discussions:

How do customers move data from existing on-premise applications into new applications in the Cloud?
What compliance artifacts does Microsoft provide to its Cloud customers?
Does Microsoft provide architectural diagrams of what its cloud services look like to its customers?
What process does Microsoft use for incident response in the Cloud?

My next stop on this tour is San Diego on April 14th and there are still a few other opportunities to learn more about Microsoft’s approach to building the industry’s most trustworthy Cloud. Please refer to the Transparency & Trust Series event schedule. As always, your Microsoft account team is available if you have any questions about these events.
