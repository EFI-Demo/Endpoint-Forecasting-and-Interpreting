This month’s release is headlined by an official patch for the critical remote code execution vulnerability disclosed earlier this month in MSHTML. CVE-2021-40444 is being actively exploited in the wild, according to Microsoft, and proof-of-concept code is now available, potentially widening the potential for attacks exploiting this vulnerability. The most serious vulnerability is CVE-2021-36965, a remote code execution vulnerability in Windows WLAN. This vulnerability has a severity score of 8.8 out of a possible 10, the same score as CVE-2021-40444. Aside from the aforementioned MSHTML exploit, another critical vulnerability exists in the Windows scripting engine. CVE-2021-26435 could allow an attacker to corrupt memory on the victim machine by tricking the user into opening a specially crafted file or visiting a website containing an attacker-create file designed to exploit this vulnerability. Snort SIDs: 58120 – 58135 Snort 3 SID: 300049  ClamAV signature: 9891528 (Doc.Exploit.CVE_2021_40444-9891528-0) Cisco Secure OSQuery: CVE-2021-40444_vulnerability status Title: Apple patches zero-click vulnerability that opens the door to spyware Description: Apple released updates for its smartphones, iPads and smartwatches this week fixing a vulnerability in its devices that could allow attackers to install the Pegasus spyware. The company pushed the patch shortly after researchers discovered a Saudi Arabian activists’ phone was infected with the spyware via the zero-click vulnerability. If installed, Pegasus can turn on a user’s camera and microphone, record messages, texts, emails and calls and send them back to the NSO Group’s — the Israeli tech firm that created the app — customers. The researchers found that up to 1.65 billion Apple products could have been vulnerable to the Pegasus spyware since March.  Most prevalent malware files this weekSHA 256: c1d5a585fce188423d31df3ea806272f3daa5eb989e18e9ecf3d94b97b965f8eMD5: 9a4b7b0849a274f6f7ac13c7577daad8 Typical Filename: ww31.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: W32.GenericKD:Attribute.24ch.1201SHA 256: 6c62b768d8b22888724288af038bc0b6e55280ddbbe42a436cdf68889346df18 MD5: 830ffb393ba8cca073a1c0b66af78de5 Typical Filename: smbscanlocal0902.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: MS17010::mURLin::W32.Auto:6c62b768d8.in03.Talos SHA 256: 8b4216a7c50599b11241876ada8ae6f07b48f1abe6590c2440004ea4db5becc9  MD5: 34560233e751b7e95f155b6f61e7419a  Typical Filename: SAntivirusService.exe  Claimed Product: A n t i v i r u s S e r v i c e  Detection Name: PUA.Win.Dropper.Segurazo::tpd SHA 256: 9f1f11a708d393e0a4109ae189bc64f1f3e312653dcf317a2bd406f18ffcc507 MD5: 2915b3f8b703eb744fc54c81f4a9c67f Typical Filename: VID[1].dat Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: Win.Worm.Coinminer::1201 SHA 256: fad16599a866f466bdeff2a716b9aa79faa6677f2895f0b262cf9402deb4b66c MD5: 04c1f4395f80a3890aa8b12ebc2b4855 Typical Filename: zReXhNb Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: Auto.FAD16599A8.241842.in07.Talos Keep up with all things Talos by following us on Twitter. Snort, ClamAV and Immunet also have their own accounts you can follow to keep up with their latest updates.
