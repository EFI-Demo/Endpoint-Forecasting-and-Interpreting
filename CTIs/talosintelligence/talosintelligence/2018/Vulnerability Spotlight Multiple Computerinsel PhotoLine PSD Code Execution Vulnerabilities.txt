Discovered by Tyler Bohan of Cisco Talos


Overview

Today, Cisco Talos is disclosing a vulnerability within Computerinsel PhotoLine's PSD-parsing functionality. Photoline is an image processing tool used to modify and edit images, as well as other graphic-related material. This product has a large user base and is popular in its specific field. The vulnerable component is in the handling of PSD documents. PSD is a document  format used by Adobe Photoshop, and is supported by many third-party applications throughout the industry.

The vulnerability arises in parsing the PSD document. The application takes data directly from the document without verification and uses it to calculate an address. The document has a specially crafted blending channel value leading to this miscalculation. Below is the area of the crash.


TALOS-2018-0546 - Computerinsel Photoline TIFF Samples Per Pixel Parsing Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-3861)

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the TIFF parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline 20.53. A specially crafted TIFF image processed via the application can lead to an out of bounds write overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a TIFF image to trigger this vulnerability and gain code execution. Detailed vulnerability information can be found here.


TALOS-2018-0547 - Computerinsel Photoline TIFF Bits Per Pixel Parsing Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-3862)

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the TIFF parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline 20.53. A specially crafted TIFF image processed via the application can lead to an out of bounds write overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a TIFF image to trigger this vulnerability and gain code execution. Detailed vulnerability information can be found here.


TALOS-2018-0550 - Computerinsel Photoline PSD Blending Channels Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-0550)

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the PSD-parsing functionality of Computerinsel PhotoLine 20.53. A specially crafted PSD document processed via the application can lead to an out-of-bounds write, overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a PSD document to trigger this vulnerability and gain code execution. Detailed vulnerability information can be found here.


TALOS-2018-0561 - Computerinsel Photoline PCX Decompress Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-3886)

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the PCX parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline 20.53. A specially crafted PCX image processed via the application can lead to an out-of-bounds write overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a PCX image to trigger this vulnerability and gain code execution. Detailed vulnerability information can be found here.


TALOS-2018-0562 - Computerinsel Photoline PCX Run Length Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-3887)

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the PCX parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline 20.53. A specially crafted PCX image processed via the application can lead to an out-of-bounds write overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a PCX image to trigger this vulnerability and gain code execution. Detailed vulnerability information can be found here.


TALOS-2018-0563 - Computerinsel Photoline PCX Color Map Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-3888)

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the PCX parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline 20.53. A specially crafted PCX image processed via the application can lead to an out-of-bounds write overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a PCX image to trigger this vulnerability and gain code execution. Detailed vulnerability information can be found here.


TALOS-2018-0564 - Computerinsel Photoline PCX Bits Per Pixel Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-3889)

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the PCX parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline 20.53. A specially crafted PCX image processed via the application can lead to an out of bounds write overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a PCX image to trigger this vulnerability and gain code execution. Detailed vulnerability information can be found here.
