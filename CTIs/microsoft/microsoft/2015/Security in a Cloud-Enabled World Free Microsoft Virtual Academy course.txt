		Recently Mark Simos, an Architect on our cybersecurity team, and I recorded an 8 module course on cloud security.

If you are evaluating cloud services for use by your organization or already managing IT assets in a public or hybrid cloud, or just want to learn more about how the cloud helps customers manage cybersecurity threats, this course is for you. Mark does a great job of providing insights that will help customers defend their cloud assets.
This course has the following modules:

Introduction and overview
Trustworthy Cloud Provider
Roadmap 1: Security Strategy, Governance, and Operationalization
Roadmap 2: Administrative Control
Roadmap 3: Information and Data Security
Roadmap 4: User Identity and Device Security
Roadmaps 5-8: Application, Network, OS, and Fabric Security
Summary

This course is based on material in the Microsoft Cloud Security for Enterprise Architects poster, which is also definitely worth reading.
You can get access to this Microsoft Virtual Academy course here: Security in a Cloud-Enabled World.
