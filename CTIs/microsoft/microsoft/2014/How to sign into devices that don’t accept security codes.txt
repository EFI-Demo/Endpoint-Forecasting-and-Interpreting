		Two-step verification makes it more difficult for hackers to access your account, even when they have your password. If you turn on two-step verification, you’ll see an extra page every time you sign in on a device that isn’t trusted. The extra page prompts you to enter a security code to sign in.
When you turn on two-step verification for your Microsoft account, it turns on two-step verification for all the places where you sign in with your Microsoft account. However, some apps (like the email apps on some smartphones) or devices (like the Xbox 360 console) can’t prompt you to enter a security code when you try to sign in, so they display an incorrect password or account error.
For example, if you’ve just turned on two-step verification, you might see the following error code and message when you try to sign in to Xbox Live:

Account does not exist.
Status Code: 8015D002
Create a unique app password to sign in
If you get an error like the one above with an app or device, you’ll need to create a unique app password to sign in. Once you’ve signed in with your app password, you can use that app or device. You’ll need to create and sign in with an app password one time for each app or device that can’t prompt you for a security code.

Sign in to your Microsoft account.
Under Password and security info, tap or click Edit security info.

If you’re prompted for a security code here, enter it and tap or click Submit.

Under App passwords, tap or click Create a new app password.

A new app password is generated and appears on your screen.

Switch to the app or device for which you need the password, and enter the app password that was generated.
