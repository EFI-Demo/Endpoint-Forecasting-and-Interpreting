Recorded July 19, 2019 — Wow, we packed a lot in this one: election security, burner phones, social apps' terms of service, and maybe the worst opsec of all time. Of course, Nigel blames Canada for all of it.

Fair warning, this episode set a new record for beeps and train horns. We primarily take a look at how an attacker would see disrupting democracy (and not in the cool startup way) by looking at the available attack surface with their intentions in mind. We also lay out some cases where burner devices make sense and where they might not. We close out with some helpful tips to enjoy a massive con like BlackHat or DEFCON. But seriously, that was a lot of beeps.


The timeline:

00:45 — Roundtable: Nigel ships up to Boston, "Cats" the movie, and FaceApp deep fakes.
13:45 — Would you like to add SWEED as a friend? OpSec is super hard.
21:45 — Let’s Destroy Democracy: An attacker's view of election security.
38:30 — Do you need a burner at DEFCON? (hint: probably not)
56:15 — Maximizing the value of time spent at conferences
1:07:30 — Closing thoughts and parting shots
