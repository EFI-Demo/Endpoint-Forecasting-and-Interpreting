We start off talking about how specific use cases don’t equate to the death of entire defensive technologies, despite the frequent assertions otherwise that you may find on Twitter. The key to defense in depth is that no silver bullet stops everything - nothing is surprising here. The big focus of this EP, leading into the 2020 election is, of course, election security. We recap some important points from our research and go over materials we have put together for election officials and voters alike.
