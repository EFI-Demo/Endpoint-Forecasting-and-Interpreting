		Every company has cybersecurity risks and needs to be aware of them, but understanding your company’s risk profile is just the beginning.

Watch this Modern Workplace episode “Cyber Intelligence: Help Prevent a Breach” to get advice on how to best approach cybersecurity at your company from two Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) – Vanessa Pegueros, CISO at DocuSign, and Mike Convertino, CISO at F5 Networks. Learn how these seasoned security executives make decisions on security spending and how they justify security investments to skeptical executives who may not have ever experienced a security breach.
Knowing what you need to protect is a key component of your security strategy. As Convertino explains, “The value proposition of the company needs to be the thing that you base your protections and recommendations on.” When you have a clear goal for security, it becomes easier to demonstrate the value of your security investments in tools and talent.
You’ll also see a preview of the protection available from Office 365 Threat Intelligence, which lets you monitor and protect against risks before they hit your organization. Using Microsoft’s global presence to provide insight into real-time security threats, Office 365 Threat Intelligence enables you to quickly and effectively set up alerts, dynamic policies, and security solutions for potential threats.
