We are pleased to announce that we are including two new URL scanners in VirusTotal: Quttera and ESET. At the same time, we are also updating Trend Micro's and Antiy-AVL's web checkers, the changes should improve their detection rates, enhancing the overall aggregate detection capability of VirusTotal's URL scanning engine.

Quttera describes its technology as follows:

WIS is a BETA version of a cloud based application that utilizes Quttera exploit detection technology. This online URL scanner investigates URLs in order to detect suspicious scripts, malicious media and any other web security threats hidden into legitimate content and located on web sites.Â 
As to ESET, its URL scanner is usually embedded in their antivirus software, providing a holistic solution:

At ESET, we are dedicated to developing high-performing security solutions for home users and corporate customers, detecting and disabling all known and emerging forms of malware.
We are really excited to announce these changes since we have just reached 37 URL scanners, even though not all of them always show up due to timeout issues. We will soon catch up with the number of file scanners. If your company/team develops a link checker or maintains a malicious URL dataset do not hesitate to contact us, we will be more than happy to integrate your solution/dataset.
