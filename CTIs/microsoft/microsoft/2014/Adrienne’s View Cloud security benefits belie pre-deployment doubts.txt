		Cloud security is often better than customers expect it to be. I’ve blogged about that trend before, including the Cloud Trust Study (commissioned by Microsoft and conducted by comScore) showing high percentages of small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs) seeing improved security after moving to the cloud.
Two recent studies add further evidence that security apprehensions persist — but prove unwarranted for many cloud customers after rolling out the cloud service.
Consider this finding from the Ponemon Institute’s Fourth Annual Benchmark Study on Patient Privacy & Data Security:
“Seventy-five percent of [health care] organizations say employee negligence is their biggest worry followed by use of public cloud services (41 percent), mobile device insecurity (40 percent) and cyber attackers (39 percent).”
In the 2014 State of the Cloud study of technical professionals conducted by RightScale, new cloud customers also expressed security concerns, but the experience of adopting cloud services appeared to ease those concerns:
“Security remains the most-often cited challenge among Cloud Beginners (31 percent) but decreases to the fifth most cited (13 percent) among Cloud Focused organizations. As organizations become more experienced in cloud security options and best practices, the less of a concern cloud security becomes.”
It will be interesting to see if views have shifted when we release the results of the next Cloud Trust Study this June. I’ll share those findings here as soon as they are available.
