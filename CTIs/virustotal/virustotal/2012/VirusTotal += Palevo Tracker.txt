It seems that lately it is all about domain scanners/datasets, today we have included Palevo Tracker. Palevo is a worm that spreads using instant messaging, P2P networks and removable drives (like USB sticks), Palevo Tracker records the C&C hosts being used by the worm variants.

Since it is a malicious domain dataset it appears in the additional information section of URL reports, characterizing the hosts of the submitted URLs, you may refer to the additional information tab of this scan in order to see its output:

It is already the 3rd dataset belonging to abuse.ch that we integrate (the previous ones where Zeus Tracker and SpyEye Tracker), we are really grateful to them and would like to congratulate them for the great work they are doing.
