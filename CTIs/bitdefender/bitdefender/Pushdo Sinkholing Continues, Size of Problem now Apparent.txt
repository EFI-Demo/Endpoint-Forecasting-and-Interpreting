As can be seen, Asia is the most affected continent, in a sharp departure from the spreading patterns of other botnets which simply stay proportional with Internet connectivity in the affected countries.
 
The most affected countries, by number of unique IPs attempting to connect for the past day, are, in order:


 


Vietnam
1319


India
