I got an email saying that illegal materials were found on my computer and it would be locked until I paid a fine. Is this a scam?
Yes, this sounds like a common blackmail scam called ransomware. Ransomware is an email, website or pop-up window that displays warnings about possible illegal activities and demands payment before you can access your files and programs again. Delete the email and report it immediately.
Do you think you might have already fallen for a ransomware scam? Find out what to do.
