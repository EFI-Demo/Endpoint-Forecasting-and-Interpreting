Things to remember when updating software:Backup what you already haveUse checklistsRead the documentation for the new software (including the INSTALL file and README) you never know what might have changed since the last time you did itWhen installing from source, (and who doesn't with security software?) run ./configure --help first and check the options available (they may have changed or new things might be available)Document what you are doing (what config options you used and why etc..)Make sure the new version is actually installed after make install is doneReplace the old configuration file with the new one from your source tarball (no, really, this is important)Edit your new configuration to suit and document what you are doing and why (read your old config and notes, you did it last time right?)Test everything, make sure the software starts properly, logs properly and behaves how you expect it to etc...If the software is complex and puts a lot of files in different places on the system, it is also a good idea to start with a checklist of files that should be replaced, it might even be better to make deinstall the old version and make sure everything is gone before installing the new oneIf the software interacts with other daemons etc. make sure everything works as expectedKeep a close eye on the system itself for a few daysTake notes, the kind of notes that someone else could pick up, read and know what you did and could repeat or reverse what you have done
