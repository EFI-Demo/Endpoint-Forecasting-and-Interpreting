Vulnerabilities discovered by Marcin 'Icewall' Noga from Talos

Overview


Talos has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Hyland Perceptive Document Filters software. This software is a toolkit that allows developers to read and extract metadata from a file. It supports a large set of common file formats. In addition to this the software is also capable of converting file formats.

We identified 4 vulnerabilities that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable systems. These vulnerabilities concerns the file conversion features.

The vulnerabilities can be exploited to locally execute code as well as remotely if the framework is used in batch mode by the owners. In this context, the malicious crafted document could be automatically handled by the toolkit and a successful exploitation could result  full control of the vulnerable system. The vulnerable features can be used for big data, eDiscovery, DLP, email archival, content management, business intelligence and intelligent capture services. It can convert common formats such as Microsoft's document formats into other format (for example easier to be parsed).
