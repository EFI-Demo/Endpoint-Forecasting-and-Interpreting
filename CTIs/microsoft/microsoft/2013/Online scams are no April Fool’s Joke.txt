		On April Fools’ Day you might have fun being the recipient or the instigator of a harmless prank or two, but it’s good for you to know about online pranks we’ve seen that are far from harmless.
Phone scams. Cybercriminals don’t just email you or post on your social networking site anymore. They call you, pretending to be Microsoft tech support and offering to help you fix your computer. Microsoft will not make unsolicited calls to offer support. For more information, see Avoid tech support phone scams.
Verify your account scam. If you receive an email message that asks you to verify your username and password for your Microsoft account, your Hotmail account, or other account, it’s a scam designed to steal your personal information. The message often includes the threat of immediate account closure. Microsoft will not close your account if you do not provide personal information in an email. For more information, see Avoid scams that use the Microsoft name fraudulently.
Fake security software scams. If you see a pop-up window saying that your computer is infected or unprotected it could be a scam known as “rogue security software” or “scareware.” Rogue security software might report a virus, even though your computer is actually clean. For examples of rogue security software, see our Real vs. Rogue Facebook app.
