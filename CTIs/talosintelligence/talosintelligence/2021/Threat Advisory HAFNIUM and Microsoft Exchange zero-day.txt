Microsoft released patches for four vulnerabilities in Exchange Server on March 2, disclosing that these vulnerabilities were being exploited by a previously unknown threat actor, referred to as HAFNIUM.
The vulnerabilities in question — CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065 — affect Microsoft Exchange Server 2019, 2016, 2013 and the out-of-support Microsoft Exchange Server 2010. The patches for these vulnerabilities should be applied as soon as possible. Microsoft Exchange Online is not affected.
Patches for an additional three vulnerabilities in the same software have also been released: CVE-2021-26412, CVE-2021-26854 and CVE-2021-27078. It is believed that these vulnerabilities have not yet been exploited in the wild.

Threat activity details

The threat actor has been observed targeting an array of organizations, including infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks and non-governmental organizations. Attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities are believed to date back to Jan. 6, 2021.
The attacks start by exploiting CVE-2021-26855, a server-side request forgery vulnerability, or by abusing stolen passwords. This vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted XML SOAP payload to the Exchange Web Services API running on the Exchange Server. The threat actor has been observed using leased virtual private servers within the United States and connecting to TCP port 443 (HTTPS) on the vulnerable servers to carry out the attacks.
After the initial attack, the threat actor has bypassed authentication and can perform operations on the users’ mailboxes, such as downloading messages. The threat actor subsequently exploits additional vulnerabilities including the remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2021-26857 to execute instructions as SYSTEM, and the arbitrary file write vulnerabilities CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065 to upload webshells to the compromised host. This allows the threat actor to execute additional instructions on the compromised devices.
The attackers have been observed dumping LSASS process memory with Procdump and comsvcs.dll, using 7-Zip and WinRar to compress stolen data for exfiltration, using PsExec and PowerCat to connect and send commands to remote systems, using PowerShell and the Nishang framework to make changes including creating a reverse shell and creating new user accounts.

Threat mitigation

All organisations using the affected software should prevent external access to port 443 on Exchange Servers, or set up a VPN to provide external access to port 443. This will ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can connect to this service. However, this action will only protect against the initial step of the attack.
Administrators should immediately apply the published patches to vulnerable Exchange Servers. This will require bringing the devices up to the necessary patch level by applying previous patches, if these have not been already applied.
Cisco has been closely monitoring the situation and has released protection against the threat as detailed in the coverage section.
