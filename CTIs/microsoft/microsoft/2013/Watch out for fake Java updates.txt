		You may have seen reports about security alerts for Java recently. Java is a commonly used piece of software from Oracle, so there’s a good chance you have it installed on your computer. Cybercriminals often use fake virus alerts to lure you into buying fraudulent antivirus software. These alerts state that your computer or other device is at risk, but clicking a link in one of them could lead you to downloading malicious software.
In the case of the fake Java updates, cybercriminals are taking advantage of news about security vulnerabilities in Java and recommendations to update Java immediately. We agree that if you use Java on your device you should update it directly from the Oracle website:  

Get updates for Java from Oracle
Turn on automatic updates for Java

If you don’t, then it’s a good idea to uninstall older versions of Java and disable Java in your browser like you would for any unused software.
Java is just one piece of software that cybercriminals target. It’s important to keep all the software installed on your system up to date. For Microsoft software, you can use the Microsoft Update service.
If you think you have a virus, visit the Microsoft Security Support Center for assistance.
