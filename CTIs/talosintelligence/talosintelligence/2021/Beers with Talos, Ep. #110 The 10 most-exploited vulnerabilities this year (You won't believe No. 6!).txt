But on the actual, helpful, front, we discuss a recently released list of the vulnerabilities that are most often exploited in the wild, according to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. It's particularly interesting to compare the lists from 2020 and 2021 to see how threat actors have changed up their tactics and parse through all the information to tell you what you need to know. It's also important to question these types of reports and how helpful they are to defenders.This is also a great episode for any Snort fans out there who are interested in the old days of writing rules for some Y2K-era malware. The timeline:01:08 — Craig stole some books on TCP02:10 — Roundtable: Why we wanted to make sure Mitch listened to a Taylor Swift collab16:35 — We dissect a list of the most-exploited vulnerabilities34:00 — We throw it back to the Nimda virus41:50 — How security organizes should digest vulnerability data49:10 — Closing thoughts, parting shots: The one thing (among many) the internet could improve onThe links:CISA's 2020 list of the 10 most-exploited vulnerabilitiesCISA's 2021 list of the most-exploited vulnerabilities (not limited to 10)==========Featuring: Craig Williams (@Security_Craig), Joel Esler (@JoelEsler) and Matt Olney (@kpyke).Hosted by Mitch Neff (@MitchNeff).Subscribe via iTunes (and leave a review!)Check out the Talos Threat Research BlogSubscribe to the Threat Source newsletterFollow Talos on Twitter and InstagramGive us your feedback and suggestions for topics: beerswithtalos@cisco.com
