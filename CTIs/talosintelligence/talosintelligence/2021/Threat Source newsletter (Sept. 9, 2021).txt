The popular project management software disclosed the vulnerability in August as CVE-2021-26084, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code. Although a patch had been available for about a week, the Cyber Command warning reminded users to patch immediately, advising them to not wait until after the holiday to update. Atlassian described the issue as “an OGNL injection vulnerability” in the Atlassian Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center products, both of which are vulnerable to unauthenticated remote attackers. CVE-2021-26084 has a severity rating of 9.8 out of a possible 10. Snort SIDs: 58093, 58094 Title: Cisco discloses vulnerability that could allow attackers to authenticate in as admins Description: Cisco patched a critical vulnerability in its Cisco Enterprise Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) last week that could allow an attacker to gain admin privileges on an affected system. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency followed up with a warning to all users to patch immediately. Cisco stated in its security advisory that there is no workaround to protect against exploitation of the vulnerability outside of downloading the latest patch. "This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of user-supplied input that is passed to an authentication script. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting parameters into an authentication request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and login as an administrator to the affected device," the advisory reads. Snort SIDs: 58097 - 58099 Most prevalent malware files this weekSHA 256: c1d5a585fce188423d31df3ea806272f3daa5eb989e18e9ecf3d94b97b965f8eMD5: 9a4b7b0849a274f6f7ac13c7577daad8 Typical Filename: ww31.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: W32.GenericKD:Attribute.24ch.1201SHA 256: 6c62b768d8b22888724288af038bc0b6e55280ddbbe42a436cdf68889346df18 MD5: 830ffb393ba8cca073a1c0b66af78de5 Typical Filename: smbscanlocal0902.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: MS17010::mURLin::W32.Auto:6c62b768d8.in03.Talos SHA 256: e3eeaee0af4b549eae4447fa20cfe205e8d56beecf43cf14a11bf3e86ae6e8bd MD5: 8193b63313019b614d5be721c538486b Typical Filename: SAService.exe Claimed Product: SAService Detection Name: PUA.Win.Dropper.Segurazo::95.sbx.tg SHA 256: 5e46ecffcff9440e97bf4f0a85ad34132407f925b27a8759f5a01de5ea4da6af MD5: 0a13d106fa3997a0c911edd5aa0e147a Typical Filename: mg20201223-1.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: RanumBot::mURLin::W32.5E46ECFFCF.in12.Talos SHA 256: a10acc24581855565579bdf17d23989e67ef15343fdd2d9b6736c10be137c06c MD5: de0d35c8d3f065ec997878b31a0cf365 Typical Filename: Quote request.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: W32.A10ACC2458-95.SBX.TG  Keep up with all things Talos by following us on Twitter. Snort, ClamAV and Immunet also have their own accounts you can follow to keep up with their latest updates.
