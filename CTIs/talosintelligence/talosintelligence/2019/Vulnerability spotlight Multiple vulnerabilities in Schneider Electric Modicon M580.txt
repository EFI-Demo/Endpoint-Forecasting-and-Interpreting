There are several vulnerabilities in the Schneider Electric Modicon M580 that could lead to a variety of conditions, the majority of which can cause a denial of service. The Modicon M580 is the latest in Schneider Electric's Modicon line of programmable automation controllers. The majority of the bugs we will discuss exist in the Modicon's use of FTP.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with Schneider Electric to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers. Talos previously disclosed a separate round of vulnerabilities in this product in June.
