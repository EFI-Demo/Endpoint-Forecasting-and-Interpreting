Prod. Note: Things are a hot mess right now and the team thinks that there are voices you have needed to hear more than ours, so we held back on releasing a few episodes. We are releasing those now, please pardon any weeks-old info.  Be safe, be kind, and listen to each other.  Black lives matter. 

This is the last of the In-Between episodes. Thanks for having fun with this non-security miniseries across a span of weeks that I am not even going to try and neatly sum up in snarky podcast notes. The questions you’ve sent us on Twitter have been amazing, you can expect to see that become a recurring thing. We started this miniseries as a fun way for us to stay connected and put some extra podcasts in your playlist as we all got used to new routines and staying at home. We can’t keep that pace forever, so here is where the In-Between wraps.  I hope that you’ve enjoyed these episodes as much as we enjoyed making them.  From all of us, thank you for listening and stay safe — Cheers. 



 The timeline:

01:50 — There is no roundtable when the whole episode is banter, so why not start with "Labyrinth?"
06:35 — Random Facts with Nigel
08:50 — Your Twitter questions, non-security answers edition
21:00 — Closing random statements of no real significance
