FortiGuard Labs analyzes events in real time throughout cyberspace, including both the domain (URL) and IP level. If a website or server hosts malware, attack code, or has been used in spam emails these events will be analyzed by the lab. A history of these events, along with additional intelligence data is available through our URL and IP Lookup tool.
This is how Fortinet describes its web filtering solution which has just been integrated in VirusTotal. With this inclusion we reach 38 URL scanners, we want to surpass 40, hence, if you have any interesting malicious URL dataset or URL scanner please do not hesitate to contact us, we will be more than happy to include you!
