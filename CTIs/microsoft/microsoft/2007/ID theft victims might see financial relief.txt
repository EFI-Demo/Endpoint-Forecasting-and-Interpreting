		According to MSNBC, senators recently introduced a bill that would allow U.S. victims of identity theft to seek restitution for both the money and the time they spent attempting to recover money stolen from fraudsters. 


 

The bill is also designed to expand criminal penalties for some types of online fraud.


 

To help prevent identity theft and online fraud, take a look at these resources:


 

·          Phishing Filter: Help protect yourself from online scams

·          Recognize phishing scams and fraudulent e-mails

·          What to do if you’re a victim of fraud

·          Create strong passwords


 

 

To learn more about the specifics of the bill, see the Library of Congress Thomas search page.
