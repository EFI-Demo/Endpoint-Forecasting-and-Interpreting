This one is a little longer than usual, but we promise you it’s worth it. We recently brought together researchers from all corners of Talos to talk about what we know about SolarWinds so far, and what’s still to be discovered. Our various teams have spent the past several months diving deep into the SolarWinds supply chain attack, and this is a collection of Talos’ knowledge on the current situation. Talking points include whether it’s fair to refer to this campaign as “SolarWinds,” what other initial infection vectors there may be, the breadth of the attack and more boots-on-the-ground intelligence.
