Software Update Validation Program (SUVP)
In January 2005, Microsoft developed the Software Update Validation Program (SUVP) to enable testing of application compatibility, stability and reliability in simulated production environments. The program provided a small number of dedicated, external participants with limited and very controlled access to security updates. 
 
Microsoft Malware Protection Center Establishment
In 2005, the Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) was established to consolidate Microsoft’s antimalware research and incident response expertise into a single organization. The MMPC delivers global malware research, response and protection capabilities to help protect customers worldwide from emerging and existing threats.
