		If you are looking for a resource that will help you manage security with Windows Server 2012, then I encourage you to check out a new book which will be published in the next few months titled “Windows Server 2012 Security from End to Edge and Beyond.” 
This comprehensive book is designed to cover security for the client device that connects to server based applications, services and the servers themselves.  It also covers security for the edge of the network such as a firewall or a remote access server and finally, security for the cloud.  The book was written by Microsoft experts from our Server and Tools Business including Tom Shinder, Yuri Diogenes and industry technology consultant Debra Littlejohn Shinder.  The authors are just about complete with the book and expect to have it published in the first quarter of 2013. Check back regularly as we will provide an update when the book has been published.
