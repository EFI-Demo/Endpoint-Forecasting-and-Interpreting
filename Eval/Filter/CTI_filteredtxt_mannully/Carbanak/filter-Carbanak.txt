Carbanak copies itself into "%system32%\com" with the name "svchost.exe" with the file attributes: system, hidden and read-only.
The original file created by the exploit payload is then deleted.
Once the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the shellcode decrypts and executes the backdoor known as Carbanak
Based on the results of this operation, the attackers use different lateral movement tools in order to get access to the critical systems in the victim´s infrastructure.
This period of time was used by the attackers to get access to the right victims and critical systems, and to learn how to operate their tools and systems to get the cash out.
Carbanak creates a file with a random name and a .bin extension in %COMMON_APPDATA%\Mozilla where it stores commands to be executed. 
Telemetry indicates that the attackers are expanding operations to other regions, such as Asia, the Middle-East, Africa and Europe.
However, Carberp-like malware was found on a computer that was connected to them via VPN.
They then install additional software such as the Ammyy Remote Administration Tool, or even compromise SSH servers.
Then the malware gets the proxy configuration from the registry entry: [HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings] and the Mozilla Firefox configuration file in: %AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\<ProfileName>\prefs.js
Additionally, Carbanak can obtain proxy configuration information from headers sent through an application via SOCKS or HTTP.
Carbanak injects its code into svchost.exe.
Carbanak downloads the file kldconfig.plug from its C2 server.
Once the system is infected, Carbanak logs keystrokes and takes screenshots every 20 seconds.
To enable connections to the infected computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Carbanak sets Termservice service execution mode to Auto.
One of the best methods for detecting Carbanak is to look for .bin files in the folder: ..\All users\%AppData%\Mozilla\
The malware saves files in this location that will later be sent to the C2 server when an internet connection is detected.
Also, after executing this service, it modifies the executable code in memory in order to establish simultaneous work processes for both remote and local users. 
Before creating the malicious service, Carbanak determines if either the avp.exe or avpui.exe processes (components of Kaspersky Internet Security) is running.
Modules modified in this process are: termsrv.dll, csrsrv.dll, msgina.dll and winlogon.exe.
Once the remote code execution vulnerability is successfully exploited, it installs Carbanak on the victim's system.2.2 Malware Analysis – Backdoor.Win32.Carbanak
If Carbanak detects the banking application BLIZKO (funds transfer software) in the infected computer, it sends a special notification to its C2 server.
In this case, the victim used the Telnet/SSH client PuTTY to connect to the server, and the attackers recompiled the machine’s SSH daemon with a backdoor so they could gain direct access.
To communicate with its C2 server, Carbanak uses the HTTP protocol with RC2+Base64 encryption, adding additional characters not included in Base64.
It also inserts strings with different extensions (.gif,.htm, etc.) at random locations in the HTTP request.
Sends captured screen or process window video to C2.Downloads and runs executable file from C2.
In this case, the victim used the Telnet/SSH client PuTTY to connect to the server, and the attackers recompiled the machine’s SSH daemon with a backdoor so they could gain direct access.
Downloads and run “Ammy Admin” remote control software and adds it to the system´s firewall exclusion list.Hash
Kills the operating system through the following actions: 1- Puts in «ImagePath» registry [HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\services\ACPI], [HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet002\services\ACPI] and [HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\ACPI] bad data.
In another instance, a Secure Shell (SSH) backdoor was used to communicate with the C2 server in 190.97.165.126 (operatemesscont.net).
In this case, the victim used the Telnet/SSH client PuTTY to connect to the server, and the attackers recompiled the machine’s SSH daemon with a backdoor so they could gain direct access.
In general, the attackers demonstrated great versatility, using attack methodologies best suited to a specific victim’s operational methodology.
Loads and executes file from specified network location.Countries from which Carbanak has been uploaded

Specifically, the attackers have been detected uploading: Ammyy Admin 3.5 (f8cd52b70a11a1fb3f29c6f89ff971ec) as svchost.exe
Using the intelligence gained from video and other monitoring techniques, the attackers developed an operational picture of the victim's workflow, tooling and practices.
Attackers created fake transactions in the victim's internal database after the verification process, thus avoiding discovery of the fraudulent activity; 
Attackers used the victim's internal command utilities to insert fraudulent operations in the transaction queue.
Known exploits that download Carbanak have been uploaded to VirusTotal mostly from Russia
SC QUERY state= all | find "SERVICE_NAME" | findstr "Sys$" if q%ERRORLEVEL% == q0 SC QUERY state= all | find "SERVICE_NAME" | findstr "Sys$" >> %name%.log
The Carbanak attackers bypassed these protections, by for example, using the industry-wide funds transfer (the SWIFT network), updating balances of account holders and using disbursement mechanisms (the ATM network).
Existing telemetry indicates that the Carbanak attackers are trying to expand operations to other Baltic and Central Europe countries, the Middle East, Asia and Africa.doc
