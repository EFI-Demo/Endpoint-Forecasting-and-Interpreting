Things such as balancing risk and potential when considering the cloud and how the cloud can make security updating more cost efficient for organizations. I also announced the findings of the latest version of Microsoft’s Security Intelligence Report.
Tying these themes together, the underlying point to my keynote was that trust has been the constant imperative throughout history for a technology or radical idea to reach its true potential. The examples I gave were Copernicus’s heliocentric model for the universe, the camera and the telephone.
To see what I mean, please check out my presentation below and share your thoughts on trust and technology.
