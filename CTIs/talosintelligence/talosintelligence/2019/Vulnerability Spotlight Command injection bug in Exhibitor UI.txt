Exhibitor Web UI contains an exploitable command injection vulnerability in its Config editor. Exhibitor is a ZooKeeper supervisory process. Exhibitor's Web UI does not have any form of authentication, and prior to version 1.7.0, did not have any way to specify which interfaces to listen on. Exposing Exhibitor is dangerous for the ZooKeeper ensemble because Exhibitor allows the changing of the ZooKeeper configuration, and also provides a UI for viewing and modifying keys and values stored in ZooKeeper. This could eventually allow an attacker to manipulate Exhibitor when launching ZooKeeper.

Per Cisco's vulnerability disclosure policy, we are publishing the details of this vulnerability without a patch from Exhibitor after a set deadline.
