EP19 Show Notes: 



Quotes intended, we think you know why. Mitch takes control to present the best of the first (partial) year of the podcast. He covers some of our guests, some of our favorite non-security bits, and a look back at our in-the-moment view of some of the top stories of the year. 


Things you can look forward to: A few of our favorite bits from 2017, Mitch struggling through sailing solo with unnecessary ukulele music, and some of our questionable moments...but the clips are really good!
