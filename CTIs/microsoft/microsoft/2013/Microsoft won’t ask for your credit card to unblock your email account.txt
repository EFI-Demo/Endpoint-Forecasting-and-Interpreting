I’m getting messages from Microsoft about my email account. The messages say that my account is blocked and I can only unblock it with a credit card number. Is this legit?
No, these messages sound like a phishing scam, a type of identity theft designed to steal your personal information, such as credit card numbers, passwords, account data, or other information. Never provide personal information in response to requests like this. In fact, it’s best not to respond at all. Instead, delete the email message and report it.
If you can’t access your email account, get information on how to recover your hacked account.
