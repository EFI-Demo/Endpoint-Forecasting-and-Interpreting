Overview
Discovered by Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos.

Talos is disclosing a pair of vulnerabilities in Foxit PDF Reader. Foxit PDF Reader is a popular free program for viewing, creating, and editing PDF documents. It is commonly used as an alternative to Adobe Acrobat Reader and has a widely used browser plugin available.


TALOS-2018-0588



TALOS-2018-0588 / CVE-2018-3924 is an exploitable user-after-free vulnerability that exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit's PDF Reader. As a complete feature-rich PDF reader Foxit supports JavaScript for interactive documents and dynamic forms. When executing embedded JavaScript code a document can be cloned, which frees a lot of used objects, but the JavaScript can continue to execute, potentially leading to a user-after-free condition. This particular vulnerability lies in invoking the 'mailForm' method of the active document resulting in arbitrary code execution.

A specially crafted PDF file could trigger this vulnerability. There are a couple of different ways an adversary could leverage this attack including tricking a user to opening a malicious PDF or, if the browser plugin is enabled, simply viewing the document on the Internet could result in exploitation. Full details of the vulnerability can be found here.
