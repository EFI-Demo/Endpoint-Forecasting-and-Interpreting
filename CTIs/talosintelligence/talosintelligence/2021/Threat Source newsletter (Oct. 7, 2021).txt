Amnesty International recently made international headlines when it released a groundbreaking report on the widespread use of Pegasus to target international journalists and activists. Adversaries have set up a phony website that looks like Amnesty International's — a human rights-focused non-governmental organization — and points to a promised anti-virus tool to protect against the NSO Group's Pegasus tool. However, the download actually installs the little-known Sarwent malware. Sarwent contains the usual abilities of a remote access tool (RAT) — mainly serving as a backdoor on the victim machine — and can also activate the remote desktop protocol on the victim machine, potentially allowing the adversary to access the desktop directly.  Snort SIDs: 54357, 57901  SonicWall patches critical vulnerability in remote connect device Description: SonicWall released a security update for its Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 line of devices.
