		City life is changing – there is no doubt about that. Unprecedented population shifts and extraordinary growth have impacted how urban populations live and work together. For city leaders, this rapid change has created not only unique challenges, but also significant opportunities.
Many are looking to technologies like the Cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to solve growing problems, and for good reason. The Cloud increases efficiency and simplifies operations in ways never thought possible in the past and devices make connectivity possible anytime and anywhere. These improvements help city leaders focus more heavily on managing and modernizing services for their citizens, and tackling the challenges of running their cities.
Introducing new technology, though, has its own set of risks. In terms of cybersecurity, it’s important to fully understand these complex issues and have a well-thought strategy in place. Microsoft remains committed to supporting National and City governments in developing a unified approach to cybersecurity. Furthering this commitment, Microsoft CityNext has recently joined the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) as a platform partner to help build resilience in cities around the world.
As a platform partner, Microsoft will offer 100RC member cities a wealth of best practices, resources, and industry expertise gained from extensive experience in the cybersecurity space, including a seven-step approach to help cities design and implement cybersecurity strategies. We hope that this partnership further emphasizes the need for cities to develop holistic strategies, and will help leaders enhance services, manage operations, and protect citizens.
