    



Today, Talos is publishing a glimpse into the most
prevalent threats we've observed between Feb. 5 and
Feb. 12. As with previous roundups, this post isn't meant to
be an in-depth analysis. Instead, this post will summarize the threats
we've observed by highlighting key behavioral characteristics,
indicators of compromise, and discussing how our customers are automatically
protected from these threats.


As a reminder, the information provided for the following threats
in this post is non-exhaustive and current as of the date of
publication. Additionally, please keep in mind that IOC searching
is only one part of threat hunting. Spotting a single IOC does not
necessarily indicate maliciousness. Detection and coverage for the
following threats is subject to updates, pending additional threat
or vulnerability analysis. For the most current information, please
refer to your Firepower Management Center,
Snort.org, or
ClamAV.net.



For each threat described below, this blog post only lists 25 of the
associated file hashes and up to 25 IOCs for each category. An
accompanying JSON file can be found here
that includes the complete list of file hashes, as well as all other IOCs
from this post. A visual depiction of the MITRE ATT&CK techniques
associated with each threat is also shown. In these images, the brightness
of the technique indicates how prevalent it is across all threat files where
dynamic analysis was conducted.  There are five distinct shades that are used,
with the darkest indicating that no files exhibited technique behavior and the
brightest indicating that technique behavior was observed from 75 percent or
more of the files.


The most prevalent threats highlighted in this roundup are:





    Threat Name
    Type
    Description






  Win.Worm.Razy-9830714-0


    Worm


    Razy is oftentimes a generic detection name for a Windows trojan. It collects sensitive information from the infected host and encrypt the data, and send it to a command and control (C2) server. Information collected might include screenshots. The samples modify auto-execute functionality by setting and creating a value in the registry for persistence.





  Win.Dropper.Zbot-9830578-0


    Dropper


    Zbot, also known as Zeus, is a trojan that steals information, such as banking credentials, using methods such as key-logging and form-grabbing.





  Win.Dropper.Kovter-9829554-1


    Dropper


    Kovter is known for its fileless persistence mechanism. This family of malware creates several malicious registry entries which store its malicious code. Kovter is capable of reinfecting a system, even if the file system has been cleaned of the infection. Kovter has been used in the past to spread ransomware and click-fraud malware.





  Win.Dropper.Cerber-9829555-1


    Dropper


    Cerber is ransomware that encrypts documents, photos, databases and other important files. Historically, this malware would replace files with encrypted versions and add the file extension ".cerber," although in more recent campaigns other file extensions are used.





  Win.Dropper.Emotet-9829584-0


    Dropper


    Emotet is one of the most widely distributed and active malware families today. It is a highly modular threat that can deliver a wide variety of payloads. Emotet is commonly delivered via Microsoft Office documents with macros, sent as attachments on malicious emails.





  Win.Packed.Dridex-9829614-1


    Packed


    Dridex is a well-known banking trojan that aims to steal credentials and other sensitive information from an infected machine.





  Win.Worm.Gh0stRAT-9829943-1


    Worm


    Gh0stRAT is a well-known family of remote access trojans designed to provide an attacker with complete control over an infected system. Capabilities include monitoring keystrokes, collecting video footage from the webcam, and uploading/executing follow-on malware. The source code for Gh0stRAT has been publicly available on the Internet for years, significantly lowering the barrier for actors to modify and reuse the code in new attacks.





  Win.Dropper.DarkComet-9829678-1


    Dropper


    DarkComet and related variants are a family of remote access trojans designed to provide an attacker with control over an infected system. Capabilities of this malware include the ability to download files from a user's machine, mechanisms for persistence and hiding, and the ability to send back usernames and passwords from the infected system.





  Win.Dropper.HawkEye-9829906-0


    Dropper


    HawkEye is an information stealing malware that specifically targets usernames and passwords stored by web browsers and mail clients on an infected machine. It is commonly spread via email and can also propagate through removable media.

    Exploit Prevention
    
    Cisco AMP for Endpoints protects users from a variety of malware functions with exploit
    prevention. Exploit prevention helps users defend endpoints from memory attacks commonly
    used by obfuscated malware and exploits. These exploits use certain features to bypass
    typical anti-virus software, but were blocked by AMP thanks to its advanced scanning
    capabilities, even protecting against zero-day vulnerabilities.
    

    
    
    
        
        
            Process hollowing detected - (13544)
        
    
    
        
            Process hollowing is a technique used by some programs to avoid static analysis. In typical usage, a process is started and its obfuscated or encrypted contents are unpacked into memory. The parent then manually sets up the first stages of launching a child process, but before launching it, the memory is cleared and filled in with the memory from the parent instead.

            Crystalbit-Apple DLL double hijack was detected. During this attack, the adversary abuses two legitimate vendor applications, such as CrystalBit and Apple, as part of a dll double hijack attack chain that starts with a fraudulent software bundle and eventually leads to a persistent miner and in some cases spyware deployment.
        
    
    
        
        
            Excessively long PowerShell command detected - (1571)

            A process was injected into, most likely by an existing Kovter infection. Kovter is a click fraud Trojan that can also act as an information stealer. Kovter is also file-less malware meaning the malicious DLL is stored inside Windows registry and injected directly into memory using PowerShell. It can detect and report the usage of monitoring software such as wireshark and sandboxes to its C2. It spreads through malicious advertising and spam campaigns.
