		In a previous blog entry we asked you to contact us if you’ve experienced online fraud or phishing. We received several questions from people who weren’t sure if the e-mail messages they’d received were phishing scams. 


 

Although we can’t respond directly to every message, we wanted to address a few of your concerns here. 


 

Also, we’re still looking for stories from people who’ve had their identity stolen by an online criminal. So, use the Email link above this entry to tell us your story.


 


 

What are phishing scams?

Phishing scams are fraudulent e-mails or Web sites that try to fool you into filling out forms that could be used to steal your personal or financial information or account passwords. For more information on phishing scams, see Recognize phishing scams and fraudulent e-mails.


 

How can I tell if an e-mail is a phishing scam?

Phishing e-mails often include official-looking logos from real organizations and other identifying information taken directly from legitimate Web sites. They might also contain the following common phrases:


 

·          “Verify your account.”

·          “Dear Valued Customer.”

·          “During regular account maintenance…”


 

For more information see, Recognize phishing scams and fraudulent e-mails.


 

What should I do if I receive a phishing scam?

If you think you’ve received a phishing scam, delete the e-mail. Do not click any links in the message. For more information, see How to handle suspicious e-mail.
