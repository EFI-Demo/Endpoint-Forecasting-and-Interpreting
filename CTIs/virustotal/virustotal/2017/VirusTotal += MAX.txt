We welcome MAX scanner to VirusTotal. This scanner was developed by Saint Security Inc, headquartered in Seoul, South Korea. In the words of the company:


“MAX is a machine learning and cloud-based next-generation antivirus engine that identifies malware with AI. MAX, as a part of the malwares.com Project launched by Saint Security in 2014, is designed to detect malware by using intelligence data from malwares.com. It identifies various malware by nature, maximizes detection rate and minimizes false-positives with multi-layer and whitelist learning. In addition, MAX detects various types of files such as Windows binary files (32bit, 64bit), Linux elf files, mobile APK files, etc.”

Saint Security has expressed its commitment to follow the recommendations of AMTSO and, in compliance with our policy, facilitates this review by SE Labs, an AMTSO-member tester.
