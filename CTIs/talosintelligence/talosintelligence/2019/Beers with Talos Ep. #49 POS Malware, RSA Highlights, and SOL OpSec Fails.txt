Recorded March 15, 2019. We recorded this after coming back from RSA, with some on-location highlights included. This episode opens a bit more thought-provoking than we typically do, and we move toward discussing point-of-sale malware like Glitch. After the RSA highlights, we discuss OpSec fails, and Nigel becomes a Burning Man convert after learning there are people there on drugs with rockets that he watches for fun.

The timeline:

01:15 — Roundtable: Some different, if not important takes today.
16:00 — Glitch POS: Why POS is a hot vector ($$$$)
34:00 — RSA Highlights and random musings (with Ashely Kane and Matt Watchinski)
45:10 — OpSec fails: Try to avoid sending photos of your felonies to police
54:00 — Closing thoughts, parting shots
