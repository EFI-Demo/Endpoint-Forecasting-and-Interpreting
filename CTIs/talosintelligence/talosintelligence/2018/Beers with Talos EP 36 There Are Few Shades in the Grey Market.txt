Ep. #36 show notes: 
Recorded Aug. 24, 2018 — We’re finally back in the studio after Hacker Summer Camp! Sadly, due to summer vacations and becoming bionic, we are missing Joel and Nigel, respectively. We end up discussing most of our topics through the lens of Matt’s frequent Twitter polls. We also find out he bribes followers with free sporks. Craig brings the discussion on the details of Remcos, and goes through some interesting points on the emerging grey markets in security software and "vuln disco." The crew closes this episode discussing the hypothetical merits of perfect patching versus perfect visibility.
