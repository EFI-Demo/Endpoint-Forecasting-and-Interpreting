Vulnerability discovered by Marcin Noga of Cisco Talos
Overview
Talos has discovered two remote code execution vulnerabilities in the the FreeXL library. FreeXL is an open source C library to extract valid data from within an Excel (.xls) spreadsheet. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on  the victim's machine. If an attacker builds a specially crafted XLS (Excel) file and the victim opens it with an application using the FreeXL library, the attackers code will be executed with the privileges of the local user.

Details 
TALOS-2017-0430 / CVE-2017-2923An exploitable heap based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the read_biff_next_record function of the FreeXL library. The vulnerability occurs when the Binary Interchange File Format (BIFF) record size is bigger than the workbook->record field in the read_biff_next_record function.A specially crafted xls file can cause a memory corruption resulting in remote code execution. An attacker who sends a malicious XLS file, can use this to overwrite large parts of memory to crash the application or to execute arbitrary code by overwriting critical control flow structures. More information can be found in the full report.

TALOS-2017-0431 / CVE-2017-2924Another exploitable heap based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the read_legacy_biff function of the FreeXL library. The buffer overflow occurs in the function if it parses the DIMENSION record filled with data from a malicious XLS file. To trigger the vulnerability the malicious XLS file needs be in BIFF format. An attacker can use this to overwrite large parts of memory to crash the application or to execute arbitrary code by overwriting critical control flow structures. For further information, see the full report.
