Cisco Talos and Cisco Secure are launching a new video series to fill you in on the latest cybersecurity trends. We’re thrilled to launch our first video in the new Talos Threat Update series, which you can watch above or over at this link, where Martin Lee and Hazel Burton talk about wiper malware  — what is it, why is it important and how you can prepare your organization against it. While this series is primarily focused on the European region, the advice and topics covered each month apply to users everywhere.  In each video, Hazel Burton dives into important security topics with Cisco Secure researchers, asking the tough questions and giving straight answers.
