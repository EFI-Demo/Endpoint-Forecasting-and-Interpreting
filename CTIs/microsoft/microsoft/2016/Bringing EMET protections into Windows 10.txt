The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) was born as a stop-gap solution to deliver tactical mitigations against certain zero-day software vulnerabilities and over time it’s proven effective against a wide range of vulnerability exploit techniques. Since its first release in 2009 we’ve received a great deal of feedback on it and one common request was to include EMET functionality directly into Windows itself.
With Windows 10 we’ve integrated the many mitigation features that EMET administrators have come to rely on directly into the system. With the Windows 10 Anniversary Update our efforts have achieved critical mass and so EMET 5.5 is entering into the sustained engineering part of its lifecycle. More background information on EMET, it’s integration into Windows 10, and the updated support statement can be found in the Moving Beyond EMET post which can be found on Security Research & Defense blog.
