These attacks commonly use lure documents that pertain to fake flight itineraries, bills and more, and could possibly be targeting airlines themselves.This is a perfect example of the various pitfalls, pivots and waves that come as part of a malware investigation, so we felt it was a great time to have Vitor on. He discusses what he learned about the threat actor in this case, what threw him off, and what he can learn for the next time he goes to look into a threat actor. Apple Podcasts Spotify  Stitcher
