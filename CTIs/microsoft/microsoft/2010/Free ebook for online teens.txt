keep themselves and their stuff safer online. In partnership with security
expert and author, Linda
McCarthy, this free downloadable version of her new book, “Own
Your Space – Keep Yourself and Your Stuff Safe Online” is written for computer
and Internet savvy “tweens” and teens and their parents or educators.
Here are a few of the topics covered in the book:


Cyberbullying

Hackers and crackers

Social networking

Phishing

Spam

When asked why she decided to partner with Microsoft
to post her book online for free, author and OwnYourSpace founder says, “It is
increasingly more important that schools and families have access to free
security information to protect themselves on the Internet.” 
To
download the entire book, or individual chapters, go to “Own Your Space – Keep Yourself and Your Stuff Safe
Online” Digital Book for Teens.
