		I was in Omaha and Des Moines last week speaking at more Transparency & Trust in the Cloud events. The events in Omaha and Des Moines were very well attended; thank you very much to all the customers that made time to join us. The feedback from the CIOs, CISOs, attorneys, and IT professionals that attended has been very positive.

I learn from the customers attending these events as much as they learn from the speakers. The themes that emerged during the conversations in Omaha and Des Moines included:

Is Microsoft’s plan to get every compliance certification and attestation possible in every country/region where it does business?
Does Microsoft sign Business Associate Agreements?
How does Microsoft help its customers during incident response investigations?
What are best practices for managing crisis communications during and after a breach?
What is Microsoft doing to help governments craft public policy for cybersecurity?

My next stops on this tour are Mountain View on April 16th, and San Diego on May 14th. If you are an enterprise customer and would like to learn more about Microsoft’s approach to building the industry’s most trustworthy Cloud, check out the current Transparency & Trust in the Cloud event schedule and please reach out to your account team to find out if one of these events is coming to your area in the future.
I’m also speaking at the RSA Conference 2015 in San Francisco on April 21st – if you are attending the conference, please check out some of the Microsoft sessions.
