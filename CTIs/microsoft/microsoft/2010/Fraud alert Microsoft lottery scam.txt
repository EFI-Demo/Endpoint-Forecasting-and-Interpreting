		We wanted to remind you about a fraudulent email scam that seems to be on the rise.
If you receive an email that claims you’ve won a lottery that’s sponsored by Microsoft, you can be sure that this is an advanced fee fraud. These emails usually ask you to provide cash up-front in order to receive your prize.  This is a scam. Delete the email and don’t respond.
