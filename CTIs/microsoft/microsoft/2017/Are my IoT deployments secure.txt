		According to IDC, there will be 28.1 billion connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices by 2020. Considering the numerous benefits of IoT—connected assets, predictive analytics, real-time intelligence—this isn’t all that surprising. But what about the inherent risks? IoT-based infrastructure is a wonderful intelligence tool, but, if not properly secured, can open the door for cyberattacks. A recent example of this is the massive hacking operation that brought down Twitter, Reddit, Spotify, and AirBnb in a single night. So, if you want to reap IoT benefits, how can you do it safely?
