ThreatHive is a domain and IP reputation tracking system comprised of data collected from various sources including sandboxing , collecting data from various spampot systems and independent research.Â 
This is how The Malwarelab describes its ThreatHive initiative which has just been integrated in VirusTotal. With this inclusion we are well over the 40 URL scanners, over the weekend we have integrated some new engines that we will be announcing in the coming days.

Thank you The Malwarelab!
