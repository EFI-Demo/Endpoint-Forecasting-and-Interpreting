T'was the night before Christmas, and all through the net,not a hacker was stirring, not even FX,the servers all hummed in post-purchase daze,to await the deluge of gift-card traffic craze,				The VRT was drinking, three sheets to the wind,in order to escape both family and friend,Matt, Shong, and Ryan had all left for sushi,while somewhere some script kiddy was being real douchey,				When on Milw0rm was released remote pwn,Patrick sprang to his laptop, picked up his cell phone,we put down our egg nog, relinquished our tumblers,busted out hex editors, checked all the numbers,				A file template built, Pat now had the vision,To find oddness in song tempo, and time division, and what in my windbg window should appear,but a #DE error, no int overflow here!				Now checking in IDA, and tweaking edx,no memory moved, no additional wrecks, not a vuln at all here! Not nearly the same,I can't believe we stopped drinking for something so lame!				The problem's control of four high order bytes,when in simple division the quotient's not right,the value produced must fit inside a DWORD,if the value's too big the proc flips you the bird				So we've penned you this poem to put you at ease,and save you the folly, the stress, (or the tease!),so before we get plastered real good and right,Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!
