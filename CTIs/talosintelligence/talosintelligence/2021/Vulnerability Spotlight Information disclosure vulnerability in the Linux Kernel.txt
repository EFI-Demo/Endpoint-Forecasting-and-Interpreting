Lilith >_> and Claudio Bozzato of Cisco Talos discovered this vulnerability. Blog by Jon Munshaw. Cisco Talos recently discovered an information disclosure vulnerability in the Linux Kernel.  The Linux Kernel is the free and open-source core of Unix-like operating systems. This vulnerability specifically exists in the /proc/pid/syscall functionality of 32-bit ARM devices running Linux. TALOS-2020-1211 (CVE-2020-28588) is an information disclosure vulnerability that could allow an attacker to view Kernel stack memory . We first discovered this issue on an Azure Sphere device (version 20.10), a 32-bit ARM device that runs a patched Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by reading /proc/<pid>/syscall, a legitimate Linux operating system file  — making it impossible to detect on a network remotely. If utilized correctly, an attacker could leverage this information leak to successfully exploit additional unpatched Linux vulnerabilities. Cisco Talos worked with Linux to ensure that that this issue is resolved and an update is available for affected customers, all in adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. Users are encouraged to update these affected products as soon as possible: Linux Kernel versions 5.10-rc4, 5.4.66 and 5.9.8. Talos tested and confirmed these versions of the Linux Kernel could be exploited by this vulnerability.
