The Mozilla Firefox web browser contains a vulnerability in its SharedWorkerService function that could allow an attacker to gain the ability to remotely execute code on a target’s machine. This vulnerability can be triggered if the user visits a malicious web page. The attacker can design this page in a way that it would cause a race condition, eventually leading to a use-after-free vulnerability and remote code execution.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with Mozilla to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
