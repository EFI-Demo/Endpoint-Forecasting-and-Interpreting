EP11 Show Notes: 
Better late than never? On top of being distributed all around the planet this week, we had some technical issues with our recording platform that created a nice audio jigsaw puzzle to solve. Matt’s audio remained a challenge; it is rough this week.  Bear with us, the audio quality will be back to what you have come to expect next episode.  If you would like to speak to the manager, please hold. 

The last several years have seen a continuing surge in booters, DDOS, and combined exploit campaigns for-hire coming out of Asia and other regions. What does this tell us about the continued “professionalization” of the cyber criminal enterprise? What happens now that the playing field is leveled and launching these attacks requires nothing more than a few hundred USD in cryptocurrency?

We also discuss “hacking back” - some say it should be legal. Most people who know what they are talking about seem to think otherwise. Despite several strained analogies involving arms dealers, various calibers of ammo, and other nonsense, the crew makes a point about what it actually solves (hint: not much, especially considering the low chances of 100% certainty for most observers)
