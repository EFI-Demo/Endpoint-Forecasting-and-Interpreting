Recorded April 12, 2019 — Today, we rip through a few other things to spend most of our time discussing Sea Turtle, the latest DNS hijacking campaign discovered by Talos. Also, Joel causes the biggest blockchain outburst in some time. Special thanks for today’s podcast goes to Danny Adamitis, the main Talos researcher on the Sea Turtle campaign. Danny was going to be with us today, but experienced some technical issues that prevented that from happening. RIP Danny’s mic: 4-12-19.

The timeline:
