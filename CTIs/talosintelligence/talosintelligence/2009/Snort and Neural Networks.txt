Jacson Rodrigues Correia da Silva just finished his Bachelors degree in computer science. As part of his final project, he came up with an implementation that allows you to use Snort with JavaNNS. (see http://www.cis.cau.edu/675/javasnns.html). This means, you could use Snort in an artificial neural network. Pretty cool no?You can find his work here: http://jacsonrcsilva.googlepages.com/snort-rna (it's in Portuguese, but you can figure it out right?)Jacson is now working on his Masters degree, hopefully he'll have more cool stuff to show off when he's done with that too.
