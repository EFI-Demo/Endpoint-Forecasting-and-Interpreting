The one thing many cyber attacks had in common? People. There are issues that arise any time humans are involved, whether it's being tempted by a phish or someone making simple human errors. So, Matt, Mitch and Liz discuss how logs are crucial during the worst-case scenario and look at how to remove human error as much as possible from the equation. Outside of initial infection vectors, there are plenty of other lessons learned from 2021 that we can take into incident response this year. The timeline:01:30 — Roundtable: Why are questions at Q&A panels always so bad? 07:28 — Recapping Talos Incident Response's 202116:00 — The four major cyber incidents of last year41:50 — What trends can we expect to carry over into 2022?57:49 — Parting shots, closing thoughts: We find out Matt was just working the whole time we were recording this episodeThe links:Talos Incident Response year-in-review for 2021Talos Takes Ep. #42: Seriously folks, save your logsTalos' blog on the Solar Winds supply chain attack from December 2020Find your local HMart==========Featuring: Liz Waddell (@vlsin) and Matt Olney (@kpyke).Hosted by Mitch Neff (@MitchNeff).Subscribe via iTunes (and leave a review!)Check out the Talos Threat Research BlogSubscribe to the Threat Source newsletterFollow Talos on Twitter and InstagramGive us your feedback and suggestions for topics: beerswithtalos@cisco.com
