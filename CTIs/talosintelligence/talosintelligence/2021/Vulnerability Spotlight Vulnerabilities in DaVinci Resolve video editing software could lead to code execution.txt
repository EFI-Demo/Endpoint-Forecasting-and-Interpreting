A Cisco Talos team member discovered these vulnerabilities. Blog by Jon Munshaw. Cisco Talos recently discovered two vulnerabilities in the DaVinci Resolve video editing software that could allow an adversary to execute code in the context of the application. DaVinci Resolve is a non-linear video editing application from Blackmagic Software that is available on multiple operating systems. Both these vulnerabilities exist in the DPDecoder service inside DaVinci Resolve. TALOS-2021-1426 (CVE-2021-40417) is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability that occurs when the application faces an integer overflow condition that leads to a sign extension while trying to decode a video file. Alternatively, TALOS-2021-1427 (CVE-2021-40418) could also lead to code execution, but is instead triggered as the result of an uninitialized object member as a result of an incorrect UUID. Cisco Talos worked with Blackmagic to ensure that these issues are resolved and an update is available for affected customers, all in adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. Users are encouraged to update these affected products as soon as possible: Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve, version 17.3.1.0005 tested and confirmed these versions of DaVinci could be exploited by this vulnerability. The following SNORTⓇ rules will detect exploitation attempts against this vulnerability: 58716, 58717, 58749 and 58750. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center or Snort.org.
