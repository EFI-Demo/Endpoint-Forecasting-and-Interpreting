Recorded Sept. 13, 2019 

In one of our "rantier" episodes, the BWT crew dives into the ongoing insidiousness that is cryptomining with Watchbog, and then we turn our attention to some idiot that thinks charging people $50 to bypass MFA on their own machines is a good idea, because nothing bad can happen there, right? RIGHT?! Finally, we take a look at some recent breaches and the trend of attempting to downplay the severity of a breach because the data ex-fil wasn’t “vital or important.” Again, what can go wrong with that line of thinking? This is fine. Everything is just fine. Security is solved, we can go home now.
