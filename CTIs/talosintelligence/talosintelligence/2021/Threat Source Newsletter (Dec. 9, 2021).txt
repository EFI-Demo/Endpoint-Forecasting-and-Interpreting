This campaign includes a set of malware distribution campaigns that started in late 2018 and have targeted mainly Canada, along with the U.S., Australia and some EU countries. Two undocumented malware families (a backdoor and a Google Chrome extension) are consistently delivered together in these campaigns. An unknown actor with the alias "Magnat" is the likely author of these new families and has been constantly developing and improving them. The attacker's motivations appear to be financial gain from selling stolen credentials, fraudulent transactions and Remote Desktop access to systems. SNORTⓇ SIDs: 58650 and 58651 ClamAV signature: Win.Dropper.MagnatExtension-9911899-0 Attackers actively exploiting vulnerability in popular patch management softwareSoftware company Zoho warned users that they should update their Desktop Central and Desktop Central MSP services as soon as possible.
