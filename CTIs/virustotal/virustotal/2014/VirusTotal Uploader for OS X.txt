VirusTotal Uploader is a popular utility in the tool-set of many malware fighters, it eases the task of submitting files to VirusTotal using Windows operating systems by just performing a right click on any file and selecting the pertinent option from the context menu.

Over the years the Windows Uploader evolved, being able to also quickly scan the image files of running processes, trigger scans of remote URL content before saving it to disk, etc. Even some community members produced similar utilities, many of which outperform our very own software, an example of this is Phrozensoft's VirusTotal uploader. That is the magic of building a community of passionate researchers, they will use your APIs in order to produce better tools that will benefit end-users world-wide.

Today we are proud to announce a new VirusTotal Uploader for OS X. It is available for download on our Desktop Applications page. Internally it uses our  public API to schedule uploads of files, with the exact same limitations that any public API user would experience.

Some of it's feature are:

Drag and drop a file to the VirusTotal Uploader in order to scan it with over 50 antivirus solutions.
Drag and drop a folder to the VirusTotal Uploader and schedule the analysis of its content.
Drag and drop a Mac application  to the VirusTotal Uploader.
Allow you to "Open With" in finder the VirusTotal Uploader to scan a file.






Hopefully this will lead to VirusTotal receiving more Mac applications, diving deeper into an increasingly targeted OS by attackers and allowing antivirus companies and researchers making use of VirusTotal's back-end to build stronger defenses against these threats.

It has been tested on OS X 10.8 and 10.9.  Any bug reports, feedback or feature requests are welcome.
