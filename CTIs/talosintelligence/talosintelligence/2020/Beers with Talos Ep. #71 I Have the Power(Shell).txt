PowerShell is a frequent flyer in security headlines — a powerful and oft-wielded tool for attackers and defenders alike. This episode takes a look at PowerShell and how to help ensure its security posture as an effective management tool. We also look at the missing-the-forest-for-the-trees concept behind being concerned about the latest shiny ATP before all else.
