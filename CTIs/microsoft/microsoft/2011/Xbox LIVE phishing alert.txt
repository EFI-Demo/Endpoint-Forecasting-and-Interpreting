		This week, Xbox LIVE issued a Service Alert warning that you might receive phishing messages if you play the Xbox game Modern Warfare 2. If you receive a matchmaking message that seems suspicious, ignore it.
Microsoft is aware of the problem and is working to resolve the issue. For the most current information, see Xbox LIVE Status.
