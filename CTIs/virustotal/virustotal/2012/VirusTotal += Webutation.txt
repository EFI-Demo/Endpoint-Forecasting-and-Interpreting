It has been a while since we last included a domain characterization dataset, we have just added Webutation and we would like to give them a really warm welcome.




The Webutation team describes its service as follows:


Webutation is an open community about Website Reputation and

collects user feedback and customer experience about websites.
tests websites against spyware, spam and scams with smart scanning technology in realtime.
queries

Google Safebrowsing against badware and phising fraud (which is used in Firefox as well and updates every half hour).
Website Antivirus which scans sites against adware (popups), spyware (outgoing links) and viruses.
WOT which collects some reviews about websites.
Norton Safe Web
as well as many other website feedback resources.




It is clear that thisÂ will surely enhance the information rendered in the additional information section of VirusTotal reports, it is precisely there where this tool appears because it characterizes domains rather than URLs, example:

https://www.virustotal.com/url/5ab7fdaa6cc0cbc8e17965044afe3c47266819335a9fa5533004113664bbb4ef/analysis/1348486392/

As it happened with the other domain characterization engines, the data returned by Webutation can be used for building customized scoring systems for full URLs.

Webutation, once again, thanks for your collaboration!
