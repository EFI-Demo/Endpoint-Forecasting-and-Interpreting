		On May 25, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will replace the Data Protection Directive as the new standard on data privacy for all organizations that do business with European Union (EU) citizens.[1] When GDPR goes into effect, government agencies and organizations that control, maintain, or process information involving EU citizens will be required to comply with strict new rules regarding the protection of personal customer data.
GDPR’s broad scope and holistic interpretation of personal information leaves these agencies and organizations responsible for protecting a wide range of data types, including genetic and biometric data.[2] Leading up to the GDPR rollout, many companies will be reevaluating their current data storage and sharing methods, and determining whether they need to implement new strategies. More than ever, this regulatory transition highlights the importance of prioritizing a strong and comprehensive security stance within your organization.
According to a recent GDPR benchmarking survey, although 89 percent of organizations have (or plan to have) a formal GDPR-readiness program, only 45 percent have completed a readiness assessment.[3] Regardless of where your organization and its security protocols are in terms of GDPR-readiness, Microsoft can help. Microsoft has been working on GDPR-compliant business and engineering solutions for the better part of a year. Because of our extensive experience developing products with security built-in, we’ve been a leading voice on privacy and GDPR-related issues with EU regulators.
