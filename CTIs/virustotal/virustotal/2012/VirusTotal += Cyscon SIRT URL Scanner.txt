The Cyscon team describe their service as follows:

cyscon & it’s partners/friends provide a “Security Incident Reporting Service” (SIRT) to any network owner, who is interested in receiving automated alerts regarding malware, phishing & other security related issues within his network.
You may read more about it on their web site.

We would like to give the Cyscon team a really warm welcome and thank them for allowing us to keep improving VirusTotal!
