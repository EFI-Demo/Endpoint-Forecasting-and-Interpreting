As always, customers are advised to follow these security best practices:


	Install vendor patches as soon as they are available.
	Run all software with the least privileges required while still maintaining functionality.
	Avoid handling files from unknown or questionable sources.
	Never visit sites of unknown or questionable integrity.
	Block external access at the network perimeter to all key systems unless specific access is required.


IMPORTANT: Due to the severity of CVE-2019-0708, and the high likelihood of exploitation, Symantec recommends that customers apply patches immediately. If immediate patching is not possible, customers should take the following steps:


	Disable Remote Desktop Services if not required
	Block TCP port 3389 at the firewall
	Enable Network Level Protection


UPDATE 05-22-2019: Symantec has released the following IPS signatures to detect and block attempts to exploit CVE-2019-0708:
