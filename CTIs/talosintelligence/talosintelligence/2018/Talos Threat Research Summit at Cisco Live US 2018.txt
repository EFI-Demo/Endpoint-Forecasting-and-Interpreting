Cisco Talos presents a conference by Defenders, for Defenders.

Talos had one goal in mind when creating a brand new conference: Make something that we'd want to attend ourselves.  As such, the Talos Threat Research Summit is aimed at being a one-day conference by defenders, for defenders. This summit is designed to assist you in keeping your users and network safer. Our roster of experienced speakers will share their deep expertise in network defense, tracking the bad guys and identifying trends in the threat landscape. The goal of the summit is that you will leave with up-to-date, actionable intel you can take back to your network and use immediately.  There are also opportunities for networking with your defense-focused peers and security leaders.

More information, including the agenda and speaker line-up will be released in the coming weeks, so stay tuned!
