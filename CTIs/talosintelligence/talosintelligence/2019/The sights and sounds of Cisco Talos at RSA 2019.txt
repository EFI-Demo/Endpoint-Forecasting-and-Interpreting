An estimated 45,000 people attended this year’s RSA Conference in San Francisco to hear talks from some of the greatest minds in security.

As always, Cisco and Talos had a massive presence at the conference, topping off the week with a keynote address featuring Matt Watchinski, the vice president of Cisco Talos, and Liz Centoni, a senior vice president and general manager of Cisco’s Internet-of-things business group.

Blue and orange Snorts could be seen all over the conference floor, and our researchers spent the past few days speaking at the Cisco Security booth, discussing some of the latest and most pressing threats.


After their keynote on how to protect IoT devices, Matt and Liz continued the rounds throughout the week, including sitting down for an interview with Shira Rubinoff, a cybersecurity social media influencer and author, to talk about the dangers the recent influx of IoT devices represents.

Cisco Talos would like to thank anyone who stopped by the booth, viewed our threat map or interacted with any of our threat researchers this week. For a look at what we were up to this week, click through the slideshow at the top of the post.
