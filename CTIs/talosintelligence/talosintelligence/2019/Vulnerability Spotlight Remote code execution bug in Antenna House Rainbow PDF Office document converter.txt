Executive summary
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Antenna House’s Rainbow PDF when the software attempts to convert a PowerPoint document. Rainbow PDF has the ability to convert Microsoft Office 97-2016 documents into a PDF. This particular bug arises when the converter incorrectly checks the bounds of a particular function, causing a vtable pointer to be overwritten. This could allow an attacker to overflow the buffer and gain the ability to execute code remotely on the victim machine.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with Antenna House to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
