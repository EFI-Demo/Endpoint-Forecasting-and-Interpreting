Last nights DoJoSec meeting was most excellent. We were treated to talks from:Alain Zidouemba - What to do with the UnknownRichard Goldberg- How not to get pwnd by your clientsJoe Klein - IPv6 security issuesEoghan Casey - Getting Physical with Mobile DevicesA really good line up of talks. Alain showed what to do when you find a piece of malware your AV solution doesn't know anything about yet. He was followed by an entertaining and somewhat disturbing talk from Richard Goldberg about how important it is to have good contracts. Joe Klein then treated us to a talk about the problems with IPv6 and the impending doom for some unsuspecting IPv6-enabled devices. Eoghan Casey then rounded off the evening with some examples of mobile device memory dumping forensics.Last nights food was a wide selection of Pizza and cookies (mmmm).Keep your eye on the DoJoSec website for the videos of last nights events if you missed the live streaming.
