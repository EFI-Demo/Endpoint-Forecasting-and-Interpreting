		The Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (SIR) provides information about current security threats to help protect organizations, software, and people. The report covers exploits, vulnerabilities, and malware based on data from over 600 million systems worldwide, Internet services, and three Microsoft Security Centers.
Volume 10 of the report was released today.
The data from the report illustrates a significant increase in social engineering attacks, specifically phishing attempts using social networking as a lure, adware such as pop ups and pop unders, and rogue security software or scareware.
Here is some of the research and analysis included in the report:

Highest infection rates by location 
Trends for most commonly detected rogue security software
How to get rid of malicious software that can steal credit card information

Over the next few months we’ll explore different features of the SIR. Check back with us or read the report now.
