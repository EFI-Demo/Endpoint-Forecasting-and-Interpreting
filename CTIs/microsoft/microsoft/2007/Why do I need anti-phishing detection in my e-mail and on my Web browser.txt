What is a phishing scam?

Phishing scams are fraudulent e-mail or Web sites that try to fool you into filling out forms that could be used to steal your personal or financial information or account passwords. 


 

Phishing protection starts with good e-mail practice


 

Anti-phishing detection automatically deletes the e-mail or moves it to the junk folder depending on the level of confidence that it is indeed a fraudulent message. If a message is moved to the junk folder, the e-mail client notifies you of the threat.  


 

The following include anti-phishing detection:
 

Microsoft Office Outlook 2007
MSN Hotmail
Windows Live Mail
Windows Live Mail Desktop
Windows Mail
 



 


 

Get phishing protection when you browse the Web


 

Phishing scams usually arrive in your e-mail inbox, but the trouble starts when you click a link that takes you to a page you didn’t intend to go to. And the problem is that you might not even know there’s a problem. 


 

If you’ve accidentally clicked one of these links, Phishing Filter in Internet Explorer 7 helps prevent you from accidentally providing sensitive information to a fraudulent Web site. It warns or blocks you from potentially harmful Web sites. For more information, see Phishing Filter: Help protect yourself from online scams.
