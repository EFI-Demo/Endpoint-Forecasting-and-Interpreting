Recently, when our Cisco TRAC team contacted us about some work that we did concerning the Fiesta Exploit Kit for an article they were writing, we were happy to work with them.

As discussed in the recent Cisco Annual Security Report, exploit kits have been very pervasive in the past couple years, and while the arrest of Paunch (the author of the Blackhole Exploit Kit) caused a decline in their overall numbers, they are still out there and cranking away.

We worked with the TRAC team in order to author this blog post, found over here on the Cisco Security Blog.
