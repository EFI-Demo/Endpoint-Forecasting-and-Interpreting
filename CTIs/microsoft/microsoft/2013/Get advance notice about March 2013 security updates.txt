		Today the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) posted details about the March security updates. On Tuesday, March 12 at approximately 10 AM Pacific Time Microsoft will release 7 bulletins.
The easiest way to get the updates when they’re available is to turn on Windows automatic updating. You can also go directly to Windows Update.
The Microsoft Security Bulletin Advance Notification Service offers details about security updates approximately three business days before they are released. We do this to allow customers (especially IT professionals) to plan for effective deployment of security updates.
Advanced Notification includes information about:

The number of new security updates being released
The software affected
Severity levels of vulnerabilities
Information about any detection tools relevant to the updates
