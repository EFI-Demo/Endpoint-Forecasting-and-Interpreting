When the malware is dropped by the "Authorization form may - 2013 - 115444.scr" carrier file, the logged keystrokes are stored in: "C:\Extracted\.tmp". 

When the "Authorization.exe" malware is executed it: 
Creates a copy of itself in the following locations: %APPDATA%\msnco.exe, C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\StartMenu\Programs\Startup\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10.exe

Tries to open the following file: [CWD]\ Authorization.exe.config
Entrenches in the system for persistence in the following registry locations:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10

Makes the following modifications to the registry to bypass the Windows Firewall: 
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\StandardProfile\AuthorizedApplications\List\[%APPDATA%]\msnco.exe
Value: [%APPDATA%]\msnco.exe:*:Enabled:msnco.exe

Beacons to the following C2 node over TCP port 1177: "217.66.231.245"

The attacker tries to make sure the malware will run in the system by making the second copy into the above mentioned directory (C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10.exe)

This causes the malware to execute again when the system is rebooted and re-starts the infection in the system. Once the system is infected again, it will beacon to the C2 node. 

When the malware connects to the C2 node, it will send information about the victim system, malware version, open windows, etc.

The following processes were started when the "Authorization.exe" malware was executed: C:\Windows\System32\netsh.exe, %APPDATA%\msnco.exe.

The following files were created when the "Authorization.exe" malware was executed: %APPDATA%\msnco.exe, C:\WINDOWS\Prefetch\AUTHORIZATION.EXE-0AD199D6.pf, C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\StartMenu\Programs\Startup\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10.exe, C:\WINDOWS\Prefetch\NETSH.EXE-085CFFDE.pf, C:\WINDOWS\Prefetch\MSNCO.EXE-1616CBE8.pf, [CWD] \.tmp (or when created by the original dropper: "C:\Extracted\.tmp")

The following registry values were set by the "Authorization.exe" malware when it was executed: 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10 [Value: "[%APPDATA%]\msnco.exe" ..]

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\StandardProfile\AuthorizedApplications\List\ [%APPDATA%]\msnco.exe [Value: [%APPDATA%]\msnco.exe:*:Enabled:msnco.exe]
