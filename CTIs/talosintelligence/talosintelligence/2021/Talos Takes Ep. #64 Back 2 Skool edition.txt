We hope we can provide a bit of help heading into the start of the new school year with this week's Talos Takes episode, where we talk about students bringing computers to and from school, the dangers of hybrid learning and the best steps for education networks' admins. We also address Talos' research into online homework scams and associated, follow-on malware.
