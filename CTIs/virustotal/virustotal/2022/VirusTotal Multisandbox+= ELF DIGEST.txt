  VirusTotal welcomes ELF DIGEST, the first integrated multi-sandox fully dedicated to only
  processing linux files. This addition helps put the spotlight on
  linux malware.
  
  
  In the words of the founder Tolijan Trajanovski:
  

  
   ELF DIGEST is a cloud-based Linux malware
    analysis service provided to security researchers, analysts,
    and academics. The service performs static, behavioral, and
    network analysis to extract IoCs and IoAs. The static analysis
    searches for IoCs in the strings and may also identify
    obfuscation in the form of string encoding and executable
    packing. The behavioral analysis can recognize various
    malicious actions, including VM detection, anti-debugging,
    persistence, process injection, loading of kernel modules,
    firewall configuration changes, and others. The network
    analysis can identify C2 endpoints, resolved domains, HTTP
    requests, and port scanning. In addition, ELF DIGEST utilizes
    the open-source malware labeling tool AvClass to determine the
    most probable malware family the analyzed sample belongs to.
    The currently supported CPU architectures include ARMv5, ARMv7,
    MIPS, x86 and x86_64. The detailed findings of the analysis are
    presented in an aggregated view and can be also downloaded as a
    JSON report.
  
  
  Let's take a deeper dive on some samples:
  

  Botnet on ARM with iptables kernel
  modules

  
    This sample is part of the Mirai botnet. At the top of the report we can see
    the network communication, possibly the command and control
    server.
    
    Â 

    
      

      In
      the shell commands we can observe the iptables firewall
      stopped and tables flushed. This would allow the malware to
      communicate without the firewall obstructing it.
        
     
        
      
      The linux kernel modules being loaded, which are most likely
      related to the iptables command line interactions.
      
      We can explore other pivots either on the
      relationships tab, or within VirusTotal Graph. Here we can
      see more details with respect to the command and control
      infrastructure as well as relations to other files, URL, and
      IPs.

      
      
      
        
      
      
        
      

      Mozi botnet with
      bittorrent
    

    
      Within this sample we see DNS resolutions to common
      bittorrent trackers and traffic on common bittorrent port
      6881.
      

      
      
      
      In the HTTP requests section,
      scanning for other vulnerable devices on the internet

      
      
      
      Using a file search modifier we can find similar
      samples that perform the same request. behaviour_network:"boaform/admin"

      
      
      
      
      
      
      ELF DIGEST, uploads the PCAP network traffic capture. When
      sandboxes or users upload PCAPs to VirusTotal, we analyze
      them with snort and suricata, using rules from community contributors.

      
      
      
      
      Other Interesting samples to have a look
      at:

      
        Mirai 19907fba39b0065fea0047b533d3d1f61d46c49e8ad78f65f7ad6d5d906d2d7b

        Service Scanning: cd02800b747b27a65382132770c77823304404dc0611917a21b423727d058ae1

        A coin miner detecting its environment: 6f445252494a0908ab51d526e09134cebc33a199384771acd58c4a87f1ffc063
      ELF DIGEST is a great addition to
      VirusTotal, and will help further shine the spotlight on
      linux malware. Happy Hunting!
