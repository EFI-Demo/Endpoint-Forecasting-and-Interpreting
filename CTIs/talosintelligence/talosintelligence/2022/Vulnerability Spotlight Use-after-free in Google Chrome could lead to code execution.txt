Marcin Towalski of Cisco Talos discovered this vulnerability. Blog by Jon Munshaw. Cisco Talos recently discovered an exploitable use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome.  Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser — and Chromium is the open-source version of the browser that other software developers use to build their browsers, as well. This specific vulnerability exists in a specific object in the browser that's responsible for creating streams of audio and video. TALOS-2021-1398 (CVE-2021-38008) is a use-after-free vulnerability that triggers if the user opens a specially crafted web page in Chrome. That page could trigger a use-after-free condition, which could lead to the execution of remote code on the targeted machine.Cisco Talos worked with Google to ensure that this issue is resolved and an update is available for affected customers, all in adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. Users are encouraged to update these affected products as soon as possible: Google Chrome, versions 94.0.4606.81 (Stable) and 97.0.4674.1 (Canary). Talos tested and confirmed these versions of Chrome could be exploited by this vulnerability. The following SNORTⓇ rules will detect exploitation attempts against this vulnerability: 58489 and 58490. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Firepower Management Center or Snort.org.
