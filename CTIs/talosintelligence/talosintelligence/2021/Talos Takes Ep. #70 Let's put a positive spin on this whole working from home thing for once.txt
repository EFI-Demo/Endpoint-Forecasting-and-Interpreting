Send these to your parents, grandparents or anyone who will listen! This week, we kick things off with Christopher Marshall, the leader of Talos' detection and response team. He wears many hats within Talos, though, so he's the perfect person to have on to discuss company culture and avoiding burnout.Chris talks about what he's done to avoid burnout on his team (regardless of what's happening in our world outside of security), what we're most looking forward to when we can get back in the office and the positives that have actually sprung up doing this hybrid work period.Apple Podcasts Spotify  Stitcher
