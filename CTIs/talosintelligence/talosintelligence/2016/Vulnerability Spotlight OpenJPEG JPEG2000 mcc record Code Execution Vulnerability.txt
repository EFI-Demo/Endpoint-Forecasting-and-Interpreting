Vulnerability discovered by Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos



Overview
Talos has identified an exploitable out-of-bounds vulnerability in the JPEG 2000 image file format parser implemented in OpenJPEG library (TALOS-2016-0193/CVE-2016-8332). The JPEG 2000 file format is commonly used for embedding images inside PDF documents. This particular vulnerability could allow an out-of-bound heap write to occur, resulting in heap corruption and lead to arbitrary code execution. Talos has disclosed this vulnerability responsibily to the library maintainers to ensure a patch is available.


Exploitation of this vulnerability is possible if a user were to open a file containing a specifically crafted JPEG 2000 image that exploits this flaw. Examples where this could be achieved would be in an email attack, where a user opens an attachment in a spam/phishing email, or in a hosted content scenario where a user downloads a file from Google Drive or Dropbox.
