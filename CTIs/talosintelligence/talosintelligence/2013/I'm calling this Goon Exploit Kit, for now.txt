We started seeing this exploit kit in our systems on November 21st.  It has some similarities to Redkit and the Dotcache exploit kit.

Cookiebomb redirection to:

192.168.0.58    1044    173.237.187.203 80      GET                     173.237.187.203 /cnt.php?id=786629      Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022)

Which bounces you over to:


Landing:

This is the JNLP bypass in an xml.

At the time of this investigation, the Payload 404'ed.

I'll update this blog post as more information becomes available.

Update:  After further research, it appears the structure for the URLs doing the download of the jar and jnlp files is dynamic in some way.  However, we are seeing this exploit kit now drop a XOR'd binary of Zeroaccess.  Please ensure you have VRT rule 26524 enabled, as that will detect the JWS bypass section of this exploit kit. If in IPS mode, it should stop this kit from working.  

Update-2: Added some clarification around the Cookiebomb bump.  Detected 60 installs of this yesterday.
