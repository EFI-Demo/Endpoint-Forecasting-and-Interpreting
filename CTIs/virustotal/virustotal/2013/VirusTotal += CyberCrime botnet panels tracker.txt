Xylitol has been extremely kind in letting us enrich VirusTotal's URL scanner with his CyberCrime tracker. CyberCrime is a C&C panel tracker, in other words, it lists the administration interfaces of certain in-the-wild botnets. As such, its URL database is inherently smaller than other datasets integrated in VirusTotal.

Nonetheless, one should not neglect the usefulness of this tracker, very often other malware-related infrastructure will be located in the same host as the botnet administration panel, hence, it can prove itself very useful in finding evil.

Thank you Xylitol! Keep up the good work!
