		Holiday shopping is in full swing and so are the scams. The following tips can help you stay safe when you shop online.
Use a modern browser. Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10 (available with Windows 8) include the SmartScreen filter.  SmartScreen helps protect you from fraudulent shopping websites that seek to acquire personal information such as user names and passwords. Learn more about SmartScreen.
Use strong passwords for online retail sites and keep your passwords secret. Make your passwords eight or more characters. Use a combination of numbers, symbols, and uppercase and lowercase letters (the greater the variety of characters, the stronger the password). Also, make sure you don’t use the same password for all the sites you use. Check the strength of your password.
Be careful when you shop online using a public Wi-Fi connection. If possible, save your financial transactions for a secured home connection. Passwords, credit card numbers, or other financial information are less secure on a public network. If you have to make a purchase, choose the most secure connection—even if that means you have to pay for access. Learn more about Wi-Fi safety.
