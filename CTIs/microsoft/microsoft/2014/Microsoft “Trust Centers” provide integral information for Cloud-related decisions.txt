		Security, privacy, compliance and transparency are essential elements for building trust between a cloud service provider and its customers.
Knowing this, we continue to further strengthen encryption to protect customer data, design and maintain services that meet government and industry compliance standards, and increase protection from government snooping.
In addition, customers tell us they’d like more information as to how we protect data, certifications that our services have obtained, and how we address security in the cloud. To address these questions, we’ve put together a number of resources on four Cloud Trust Centers:
• Office 365 Trust Center
• Microsoft Azure Trust Center
• Microsoft Dynamics CRM Trust Center
• Windows Intune Trust Center
You’ll also find technical resources, whitepapers, and frequently asked questions about how to implement our services and maintain compliance with key regulations.
Here’s just a sampling of what’s on the Trust Centers:
• Location of customer data within Windows Intune and Microsoft Azure
• From Inside the Cloud video series, where customers can hear how we design and manage Office 365, directly from the engineers who build and run the service
• How we use your data and regulatory compliance information (Office 365 and Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online)
