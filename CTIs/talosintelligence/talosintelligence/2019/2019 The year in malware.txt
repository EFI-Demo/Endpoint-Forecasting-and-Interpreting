From ransomware attacks to DNS deception, attackers were just as active as ever in 2019.

This year saw a number of big-name malware families come onto the scene, including Sea Turtle, one of the most high-profile DNS hijacking attempts in recent memory. BlueKeep also stirred up controversy when the RDP vulnerability was first discovered, but researchers are still holding their breath, waiting for the first major exploits to happen.

To recap this busy year, we’ve compiled a list of the major malware, security news and more that Talos covered this year. Look through the timeline below and click through some of our other blog posts to get caught up on the year that was in malware.

Talos discovers “BlackWater,” a trojan that our researchers believed with moderated confidence was associated with the MuddyWater APT.
A “wormable” Microsoft vulnerability called “BlueKeep” is discovered, leading researchers to believe the Remote Desktop Protocol bug could lead to a similar attack to WannaCry. Talos released new Snort rules to protect against this vulnerability and outlined how to defend against it using Cisco Firepower.


    

     
     June

A threat actor merges together multiple open-source projects to install malware on victims’ machines in a campaign Talos called “Frankenstein.”
Talos publishes the details of the new Spelevo exploit kit, showing that exploit kits aren’t going anywhere.

A wave of RATs and information-stealers use the well-known “Heaven’s Gate” exploit to achieve infection.
Sea Turtle returns with new DNS hijacking techniques and a growing pool of targets.
A slew of cities around the U.S., most notably Baltimore, suffer ransomware attacks, causing experts to debate whether it’s ever a good idea for a ransomware victim to pay the extortion payment.
