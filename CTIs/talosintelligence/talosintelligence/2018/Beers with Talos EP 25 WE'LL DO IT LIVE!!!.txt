EP25 Show Notes: 
Recorded 3/13/18 - LIVE from San Jose, California. First of all – we still have a podcast and jobs, so ostensibly, we did OK hosting the meeting we talked about last time. There may have even been an award involved, just sayin'.  Since we were all together and we didn’t get fired, we decided to do our podcast live after the meeting for an audience. We are joined by Talos Senior Director Matt Watchinski on this episode, discussing such existential questions as “why security?” and more concrete things like nation state vs. cybercriminal actors and their differing motivations. We also discuss router security and network devices as a preferred attack vector for advanced actors. Special bonus: Matt beats perhaps the last laugh out of the dead horse that is Paul Revere himself. #BeastieBoys #CantBooShowNotes
