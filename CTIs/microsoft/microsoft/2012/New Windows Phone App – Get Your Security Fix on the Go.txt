		This week we launched a new Windows Phone application that is designed to provide our readers with an easy way to access Trustworthy Computing blogs through their Windows Phone devices. Our Trustworthy Computing Blogs provide customers with the latest insights from our security, privacy and reliability experts, information on mitigation tools, secure development, security updates, tips and tricks and much more.  The application is available today in the Windows Phone marketplace and I encourage you to download it and share your feedback. 
Direct link to the application in marketplace: http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=0cdde67e-cbf3-4921-9f0e-fe31bd0cfca6. 

If you don’t have a Windows Phone, simply use your favorite RSS reader on your mobile device and plug in any of the RSS feeds below:

Trustworthy Computing Blog Aggregator – RSS Feed
Microsoft Security Blog – RSS Feed
Trustworthy Computing Blog – RSS Feed

We hope this provides you with another great way to consume the news and information regularly shared through our Trustworthy Computing blogs.
