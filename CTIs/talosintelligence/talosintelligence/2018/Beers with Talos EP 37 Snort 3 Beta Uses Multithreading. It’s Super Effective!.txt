Ep. #37 show notes: 
Recorded Sept. 7, 2018 — We have Joel back this week (and he is very happy to have himself back), but we lost Matt and we’re still wishing Nigel a speedy recovery from becoming bionic. This episode, we cover the latest findings in our research into a malicious mobile device management (MDM) campaign that's targeting iPhones and go over the exciting changes in the newly released Snort 3 beta (your move, Valve). Bill reprises his role from last week as sentient seat-filler that makes good jokes.

The timeline:
