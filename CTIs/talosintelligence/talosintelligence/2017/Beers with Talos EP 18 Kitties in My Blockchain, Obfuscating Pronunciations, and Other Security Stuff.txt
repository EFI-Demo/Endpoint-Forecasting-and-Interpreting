It’s the last full episode of the year!  Thanks to you and the diligent work of Matt’s loving mother, the first 17 EPs of Beers with Talos were downloaded over 200,000 times in 2017!  To show our gratitude, we are giving you not one, but TWO roundtables this week and even a special bonus rant!  Also, Mitch can’t say words good, and Craig reads us stories from the blog!

If you read this far in the notes, send us an email with your t-shirt size and "Why does Craig mess with his mic so much?" in the subject line. One email will be picked randomly (this week only) and we will send you a BWT pint glass and t-shirt.  Maybe we'll pick a few... it's the holidays.
**Update:**
We have our winners for this week - Congrats Andre, Hunter, and Matt! Wear your tees and hoist your pints with pride, lads!
