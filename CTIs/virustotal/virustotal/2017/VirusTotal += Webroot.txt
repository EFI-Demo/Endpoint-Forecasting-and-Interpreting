We welcome the Webroot scanner to VirusTotal. This is a machine learning engine from the US. In the words of the company:



"Webroot SecureAnywhere Business Endpoint Protection is a cloud-driven anti-malware solution and was the first next generation solution to offer a full replacement to conventional AV when launched in 2011.

Rather than rely on static signatures to identify malicious files and process, Webroot uses real-time monitoring and analysis of the events occurring within a device. Then, by using the extensive resources of cloud-based computing, threat and behavioral intelligence, Webroot is able to predict with negligible false positives any signs of malicious behavior. Windows PE files submitted to VirusTotal will be processed by the Webroot PE Scanner, non-PE files will not be scanned.‚Äù

Webroot has expressed its commitment to follow the recommendations of AMTSO and, in compliance with our policy, facilitates this review by MRG Effitas, an AMTSO-member tester.
