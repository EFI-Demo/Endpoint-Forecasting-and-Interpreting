By Jon Munshaw.As consumers start having more “smart” devices connected to their home network, they may want an easy solution to keeping those devices safe. But what if that device gets owned?Carl Hurd of our vulnerability research team recently discovered several vulnerabilities in Trend Micro’s Home Network Security Station. He joins the show for the first time to talk about his research, the pros and cons of these all-in-one home network security devices, and how an attacker could exploit these issues to spy on your devices.We hope this discussion spurs users to think about protecting the devices that are meant to protect their other devices, and the trade-offs of privacy when you deploy these devices on your network.Apple Podcasts Spotify  Stitcher
