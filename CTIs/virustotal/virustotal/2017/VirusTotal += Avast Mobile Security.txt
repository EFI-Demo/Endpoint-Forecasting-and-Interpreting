We welcome the Avast Mobile Security scanner to VirusTotal. This engine is specialized in Android and reinforces the participation of Avast that already had a multi-platform scanner in our service. In the words of the company:


"Avast Mobile Security is a complete security solution capable of identifying potentially unwanted (PUP) and malicious apps (TRJ). The app protects millions of endpoints on a daily basis using a wide range of cloud and on-device-based detection capabilities. Our hybrid mix of technology, which includes static and dynamic (behavioral) analysis in conjunction with the latest machine learning algorithms allow us to provide state of the art malware protection.‚Äù

Avast has expressed its commitment to follow the recommendations of AMTSO and, in compliance with our policy, facilitates this review by AV-TEST, an AMTSO-member tester.
