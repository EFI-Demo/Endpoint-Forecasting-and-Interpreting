Some weeks ago I came across gred, the truth is I had never heard of gred before, however, I did know SecureBrain, the company behind gred. I contacted them to see whether they would be interested in introducing their malicious URL dataset in VirusTotal and they made it possible with utmost diligence.

We are extremely grateful to SecureBrain and very excited to announce that they now appear in our URL reports, just as an example:
