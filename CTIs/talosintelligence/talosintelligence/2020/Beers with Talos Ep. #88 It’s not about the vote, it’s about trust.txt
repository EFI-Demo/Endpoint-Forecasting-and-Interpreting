Nigel is out this week, but we have a couple light and breezy topics on the docket: zero-day research and the institutions of democracy. FUN STUFF!! First, we chat about zero-day research tools and the questions raised around them, contrasted to the time before security research was widely accepted. We spend the last half of the show discussing some of the findings and finer points of Matt’s recently released research paper on election security "What to expect when you’re electing."


 The timeline:

01:00 – Roundtable: Sorting out the good old days
06:10 – When zero-days hit pentest tools 
14:00 – A quick reminder of the time before security research until Bill Gates email
20:00 – The measurable change in the meantime since
24:00 – What to expect when you’re electing: A Talos primer on election security
30:00 – It’s not about changing a vote, it’s about attacking democracy as a concept
