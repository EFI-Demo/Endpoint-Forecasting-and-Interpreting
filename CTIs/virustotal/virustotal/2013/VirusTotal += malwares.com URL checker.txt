Many security industry actors build solutions that lie in the perimeter of networks, inspecting traffic and discriminating potentially malicious content. One of these solutions is SIMBA from Saint SecurityÂ (others include FireEye, Fidelis XPS, Damballa, etc.).

In inspecting traffic, these solutions have a privileged position to perform correlations to discover and characterize malicious patterns, this is what allows these companies to discover thousands of malicious URLs and files every day. Saint Security has made part of their discriminatory logic available at malwares.com:

As a cloud-based malicious codes database system, malwares.com is a one-stop service to collect, analyze and detect various malicious codes or malwares such as Trojans, Viruses, Worms so that customers or end-users can make proper security policies to take countermeasures against security threats.
Today we are excited to announce that malwares.com has been integrated in VirusTotal as a URL checker and as of today URL scans will be enriched with their dataset of malicious verdicts. This inclusion is very interesting as it covers much of the threat landscape seen in South Korea, a clear example of this is the following report:
