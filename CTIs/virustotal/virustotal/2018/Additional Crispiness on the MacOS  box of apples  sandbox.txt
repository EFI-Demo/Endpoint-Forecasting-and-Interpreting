In November 2015 we first released our MacOS sandbox. We now have an incremental feature improvements live on our site to help our users get further behavioral information from samples scanned with VirusTotal

Several improvements visible to users are:



Sandbox updated to OSX 10.11 El Capitan in sandbox.  We have a High sierra update planned for later this year. 
Detailed HTML analysis report is now available. 
Screenshots of the software under analysis to provide more contextual information:

Show screenshots of what a user would see
Help determine if the sample is waiting for user input

Network traffic reports updated

Country Detection

Timestamps on file operations,  to help show the sequence of events.
Process tree is shown if there is more than one level of processes
