In this episode, we dig into a discussion on passwords and some issues and how they appluy conceptually and in practice. Passwords aren’t inherently problematic, but how they are used...sometimes is. We discuss best practices to share with your friends and also touch on MFA (and SMS as an option of last resort). Craig seems to think lock analogies are key to understanding everything. The session was two hours long and this is the balance remaining after decency and standards review.  All of us want to thank you for listening and making three years and (almost)100 episodes of Beers with Talos possible. Cheers.  The timeline:01:30 — Roundtable: THAT DUDE JUST PUNCHED A KANGAROO04:40 — Passwords: The problem isn’t conceptual, it’s practical12:20 — What auth does the future hold?21:30 — Parting shots, closing thoughts, being grateful edition25:50 — Closing interruption: The pig couch (for real, it’s a chair) The links:[blog] Your Pa$$word Doesn’t Matter [blog] It's Time to Hang Up on Phone Transports for Authentication==========Featuring: Craig Williams (@Security_Craig) and Matt Olney (@kpyke)Hosted by Mitch Neff (@MitchNeff)Subscribe via iTunes (and leave a review!)Check out the Talos Threat Research BlogSubscribe to the Threat Source newsletterFollow Talos on TwitterGive us your feedback and suggestions for topics: beerswithtalos@cisco.com
