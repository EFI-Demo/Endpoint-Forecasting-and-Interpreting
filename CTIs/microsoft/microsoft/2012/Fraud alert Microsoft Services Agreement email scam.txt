		Weâ€™ve received reports of a recent email scam that spoofs the Microsoft Services Agreement.
View the real agreement.
The scam email message replaces legitimate links in the agreement with links that can compromise your computer when clicked. If you receive mail that looks like the real agreement or asks you to click a suspicious link or to provide personal information, delete the message or report the scam.
