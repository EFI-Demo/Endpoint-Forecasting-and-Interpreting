Piotr Bania of Cisco Talos discovered this vulnerability. Blog by Jon Munshaw.Cisco Talos recently discovered multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities in the NVIDIA D3D10 driver. This driver supports multiple GPUs that NVIDIA produces. An adversary could exploit these vulnerabilities by supplying the user with a malformed shader, eventually allowing them to execute code on the victim machine. These bugs could also allow the attacker to perform a guest-to-host escape through Hyper-V RemoteFX on Windows machines.In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with NVIDIA to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.Vulnerability detailsNVIDIA D3D10 driver nvwgf2umx_cfg.dll nvwg MOV code execution vulnerability (TALOS-2020-1035/CVE-2020-5981)An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the nvwg MOV functionality of the NVIDIA D3D10 driver, version 442.50 - 26.21.14.4250. A specially crafted shader can cause remote code execution. An attacker can use this vulnerability to guest-to-host escape (through Hyper-V RemoteFX).Read the complete vulnerability advisory here for additional information. NVIDIA D3D10 driver nvwgf2umx_cfg.dll nvwg MOV2 code execution vulnerability (TALOS-2020-1036/CVE-2020-5981)An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the nvwg MOV2 functionality of NVIDIA D3D10 Driver Version 442.50 - 26.21.14.4250.
