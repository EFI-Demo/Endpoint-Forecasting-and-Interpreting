		The Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) recently noted the inevitable increase in holiday-themed viruses and worms. 

 
There’s not much new about this malware: You get an e-mail or instant message that promises a greeting, holiday image, or music. 

 
If you click the message, your computer gets infected with the malware which can easily spread to all of your contacts.


 


Remember, take these five steps to help prevent any kind of malware:


 


Use a firewall.


Update your operating system.


Use antivirus software and keep it updated.


Use antispyware software and keep it updated.


Approach links in e-mail, on social networking sites, or in IMs with caution.
