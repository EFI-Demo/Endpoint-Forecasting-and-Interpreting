The Talos Threat Research Summit is officially back.

Registration is open now for the second year of our conference by defenders, for defenders. Tickets sold out quickly last year for our inaugural event, so act quickly.

This year’s Research Summit will take place on June 9 in San Diego, Calif. — the same day Cisco Live kicks off. A pass to the Talos Threat Research Summit will not provide you access to the rest of Cisco Live.

This summit is designed to assist you in keeping your users and network safer. Our roster of experienced speakers will share their deep expertise in network defense, tracking the bad guys and identifying trends in the threat landscape. The exact speaker list will be released on the registration site in the near future. The goal of the summit is that you will leave with up-to-date, actionable intel you can take back to your network and use immediately.  There are also opportunities for networking with your defense-focused peers and security leaders.

Here’s what you can expect:


A one-day program featuring a curated agenda
Insights from industry leaders
Peer networking opportunities
Discussion focused on defender and defense strategies and tactics
