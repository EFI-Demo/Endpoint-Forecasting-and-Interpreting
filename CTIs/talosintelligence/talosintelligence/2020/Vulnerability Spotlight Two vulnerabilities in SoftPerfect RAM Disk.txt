A Cisco Talos researcher discovered this vulnerability. Blog by Jon Munshaw.

Cisco Talos researchers recently discovered that a specific driver in the SoftPerfect RAM disk could allow an adversary to delete files on an arbitrary basis and disclose sensitive information. SoftPerfect 


RAM Disk is a high-performance RAM disk application that allows the user to store a disk from their computer on the device’s space. An attacker could exploit TALOS-2020-1121 to point to a specific filepath and then delete that file. The other vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with SoftPerfect to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
