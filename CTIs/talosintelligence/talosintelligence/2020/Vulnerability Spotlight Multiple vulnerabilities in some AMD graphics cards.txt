Piotr Bania of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities. Blog by Jon Munshaw.

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in a driver associated with the AMD Radeon line of graphics cards. An attacker can exploit these bugs by providing a specially crafted shader file to the user while using 
VMware Workstation 15. These attacks can be triggered from VMware guest usermode to cause a variety of errors, potentially allowing an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition or gain the ability to remotely execute code.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with AMD and VMware to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
