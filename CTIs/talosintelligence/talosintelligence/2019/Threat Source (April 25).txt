Newsletter compiled by Jonathan Munshaw.

Welcome to this week’s Threat Source newsletter — the perfect place to get caught up on all things Talos from the past week.

If you haven’t yet, there’s still time to register for this year’s Talos Threat Research Summit — our second annual conference by defenders, for defenders. This year’s Summit will take place on June 9 in San Diego — the same day Cisco Live kicks off in the same city. We sold out last year, so hurry to register!

Weeks after our initial DNSpionage post, we published an update on the malware, including outlining new malware the actors are distributing and a growth in the number of targets.

Finally, we also have our weekly Threat Roundup, which you can find on the blog every Friday afternoon. There, we go over the most prominent threats we’ve seen (and blocked) over the past week.

Upcoming public engagements with Talos

This session will cover a brief overview of what Talos does and how we operate. Additionally, he'll discuss the threats that are top-of-mind for our researchers and the trends that you, as defenders, should be most concerned about.  


Cyber Security Week in Review



Facebook says it may have accidentally uploaded more than 1.5 million users’ emails without their permission. However, the contact information was not shared with anyone outside of Facebook, according to company officials, and all the email addresses have been deleted.
The source code for the Carbank backdoor has appeared on VirusTotal alongside builders and other code from the group behind the malware. The group behind Carbank launched the malware against an estimated 100 U.S. companies.
The U.S. says a cyber attack on Japan could count as an act of war under a mutual protection agreement between the two countries. A defense leader from Japan called it “significant from the perspective of deterrence.”
Leaders from Singapore say they will not be deterred from modernizing despite a recent wave of data breaches. The country, which prides itself on incorporating technology into its government services, recently had data leaks of several federal databases, including a list of HIV patients.
A recent study found that the password “123456” was the most popular password among users who had their accounts hacked last year. The second most popular string was “123456789.”
The Weather Channel was taken off-air for more than an hour last week due to a ransomware attack. The FBI launched an investigation into the attack.
A well-known security researcher pled guilty to charges of creating malware between 2012 and 2015. Known as MalwareTech online, the man helped bring down the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017.


Notable recent security issues


Title: Sea Turtle campaign highlights dangers of DNS hijacking
Description: Cisco Talos discovered a new cyber threat campaign called "Sea Turtle," which is targeting public and private entities, including national security organizations, located primarily in the Middle East and North Africa. The ongoing operation likely began as early as January 2017 and has continued through the first quarter of 2019. The investigation revealed that at least 40 different organizations across 13 different countries were compromised during this campaign. Talos assesses with high confidence that this activity is being carried out by an advanced, state-sponsored actor that seeks to obtain persistent access to sensitive networks and systems.
