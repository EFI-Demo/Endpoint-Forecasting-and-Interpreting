The U.S. National Security Agency released an advisory outlining several vulnerabilities that the Russian Foreign Intelligence Services (SVR) is exploiting in the wild. The U.S. formally attributed the recent SolarWinds supply chain attack to the SVR group in this advisory and detailed more of the group's tactics, techniques and procedures.

The exploits included a series of five CVEs that affect VPN solutions, collaboration suite software and virtualization technologies. All five of the CVEs have been patched â€” Cisco Talos encourages everyone with the affected software update immediately. Some of these vulnerabilities also have working metasploit modules and are currently being widely exploited. Please note that some of these vulnerabilities exploit applications leveraging SSL. This means that users should enable SSL decryption in Cisco Secure Firewall and Snort to detect exploitation of these vulnerabilities. For an example of this, see how it can be done to protect against exploits used by the Hafnium threat actor here.

Below, we'll outline the vulnerabilities the NSA highlighted, along with Snort rules that will keep users protected from exploitation. Open Source Snort Subscriber Rule Set customers can stay up to date by downloading the latest rule pack available for purchase on Snort.org.
