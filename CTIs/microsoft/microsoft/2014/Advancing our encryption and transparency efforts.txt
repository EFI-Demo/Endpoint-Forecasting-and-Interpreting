		As a company, we have been working hard to further increase data security protections in our services, to  add capacity to our transparency center  engagements with governments, and to push governments to be more transparent themselves.
In December, we announced our commitment to increase the security of our customers’ data, and our plans to reinforce legal protections for our customers’ data.  In January, we called for an international convention focused on the issue of government access to data.  Then in March, we shared the additional steps we took to protect your privacy.
We are committed to earning our customers’ trust each and every day, and today, Matt Thomlinson, vice president for Trustworthy Computing Security, shares  the progress we are making on these fronts. I encourage you to check out his Microsoft on the Issues blog post to learn more about this announcement.
