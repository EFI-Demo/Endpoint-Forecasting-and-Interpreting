		The latest volume of the Security Intelligence Report (SIR) highlights the importance of using antivirus software.
Antivirus software helps protect your computer from malicious software (malware) and can be downloaded or installed inexpensively or at no charge. Still, according to the SIR v14 findings, 24 percent of computers worldwide were not running up-to-date antivirus software, leaving them 5.5 times more likely to be infected with viruses.
Possible reasons why your computer may not be protected:

This new edition of the SIR compares infections on protected and unprotected computers, offering evidence as to how many people are not using up-to-date antivirus software and are thus facing increased risk.
If you don’t have antivirus software, Microsoft recommends that you download it now from Microsoft or from another trusted vendor. If you already have Windows 8, antivirus software is included with the operating system. You are not required to do anything to set it up. If you are using older versions of Windows, Microsoft provides a free antivirus software called Microsoft Security Essentials, which can be downloaded from our website. Many of our partners also offer antivirus software.
Data used in the SIR analysis includes (but is not limited to):

Threat intelligence from more than 1 billion systems in more than 100 countries and regions.
Microsoft Security Essentials—operating globally in more than 30 languages.
Malicious Software Removal Tool—downloaded and executed more than 1 billion times in the second half of 2012.
Billions of pages scanned by Bing each day.
