		Today at RSA, we met with Steve Lipner, partner director of program management, Trustworthy Computing and Howard Schmidt, executive director of SAFECode, to talk about security topics and trends. We attended Kevin Sullivan’s Internet Health model session where he discussed how the global security community is coming together to help protect the Internet. Last night we had a great time at the Microsoft party  with our guest security reporter, Brock Johnson. Watch our video and check back tomorrow for our last RSA post covering sessions and attendee thoughts as the conference wraps up on Friday.
