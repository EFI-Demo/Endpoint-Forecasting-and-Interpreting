		You might recall back in November, I wrote an article that discussed a new book for IT Professionals releasing in the coming months entitled “Windows Server 2012 Security from End to Edge and beyond.”  The book is now available and you can obtain a copy through online retails such as Amazon or Barnes & Noble. 

Windows Server 2012 Security from End to Edge and Beyond shows you how to architect, design, plan, and deploy Microsoft security technologies for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 in the enterprise. The book covers security technologies that apply to both client and server and enables you to identify and deploy Windows 8 security features in your systems based on different business and deployment scenarios.
Authors Tom Shinder, Yuri Diogenes, and Debra Littlejohn Shinder, are IT experts with substantial knowledge of the Windows 8 platform.  They discuss how to deploy Windows security technologies effectively in both the traditional datacenter and in new cloud-based solutions.
If you are an IT Professional seeking guidance on how to manage security with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 then I encourage you to check out this helpful resource.
