Marcin Noga of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities.

Cisco Talos recently discovered multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities in various Aspose APIs. Aspose provides a series of APIs for manipulating or converting a large family of document formats. These vulnerabilities exist in APIs that help process PDFs, Microsoft Word files and more. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted, malicious file to the target and trick them into opening it while using the corresponding API.

Cisco Talos initially disclosed these vulnerabilities on Aug. 20, 2019 in accordance with Cisco's disclosure policy, after numerous unsuccessful attempts were made to contact Aspose to report these vulnerabilities. Aspose released an update on Aug. 30, 2019 that fixed these vulnerabilities.
