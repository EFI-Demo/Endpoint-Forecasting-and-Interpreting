Overview


Talos is disclosing several vulnerabilities identified in Simple DirectMedia Layer's SDL2_Image library that could allow code execution. Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games. SDL officially supports Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android. Support for other platforms may be found in the source code. The SDL2_Image library is an optional component for SDL that deals specifically with parsing and displaying a variety of image file formats, creating a single and uniform API for image processing, regardless of the type. The latest SDL version (2.0.8) can be found here.
