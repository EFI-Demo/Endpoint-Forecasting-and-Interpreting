Tonight's DoJoSec has a change in lineup, since Lurene is on the PUP list for today, Matt Olney is stepping in to take her place and give a talk on "Custom Intrusion Detection Techniques for Monitoring Web Applications". This is something similar to the presentation he will give next week at OWASP Appsec DC 09 in that it has the same title. However, tonight's presentation will not be the same talk, instead it is geared more towards the audience for DoJoSec.If you can attend, we'll see you there. There will be a few of us on hand to answer questions and chat about general security issues.
