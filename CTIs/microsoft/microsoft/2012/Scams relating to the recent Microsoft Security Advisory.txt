		Microsoft recently released a security update for Internet Explorer in response to Security Advisory 2757760.
Scammers will often use news items (especially those relating to computer security) to try to trick you into downloading malicious software or to steal your personal information. Scammers claiming to be from Microsoft might also contact you by phone and offer to help fix your computer.
Neither Microsoft nor our partners make unsolicited phone calls (also known as cold calls) to charge you for computer security or software fixes. For more information, see Avoid tech support phone scams.
If you receive a phone call about the recent Internet Explorer update or about another technical support issue, hang up. If youâ€™re in the United States and you want to report the scam, the best place to report phone fraud is the Federal Trade Commission. For more information, see Reporting phone fraud.
If you receive a scam via email or a website, you can use Microsoft tools to report it.
