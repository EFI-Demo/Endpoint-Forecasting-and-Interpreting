		Today on the Official Microsoft Blog, Microsoft announced the acquisition of CloudKnox Security, a leader in Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM). CloudKnox offers complete visibility into privileged access. It helps organizations right-size permissions and consistently enforce least-privilege principles to reduce risk, and it employs continuous analytics to help prevent security breaches and ensure compliance. The acquisition further enables Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) customers with granular visibility, continuous monitoring, and automated remediation for hybrid and multi-cloud permissions.
As the corporate network perimeter disappears, it’s crucial to establish a strong cloud identity foundation through a Zero Trust approach so you can protect business-critical systems, while improving business agility. We’re committed to making it easier to enforce appropriate, tailored privileges and other identity controls across multi-cloud environments, as organizations adapt to hybrid work, new risks, and business transformation.
