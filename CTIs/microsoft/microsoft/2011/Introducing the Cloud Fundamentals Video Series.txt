		A big part of my job is talking to Chief Information Security Officers, Chief Security Officers, as well as VPs and Directors who manage risk for their organizations. For them, one of the top priorities that has emerged in the past couple of years is cloud computing. The businesses that these security executives support are evaluating the potential benefits of cloud computing and some have already started leveraging this new paradigm in an effort to increase productivity and lower costs. Security executives are, more often than not, involved in the evaluation and deployment processes for new online services.
As a result of many conversations with security executives from relatively large organizations, it’s clear to me that topics related to cloud security, privacy and reliability are top of mind for these security executives.   Consistently, some the cloud topics that are of interest to the security executives I have talked to include:

Compliance, audit, and certifications
Benchmarks and evaluation standards
Process transparency
Update and system changes
Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
Risk management and incident response

To share some of the cloud security, privacy and reliability points I typically discuss with these security professionals we’ll be rolling out the Cloud Fundamentals Video Series over the next few weeks In it you’ll see some of Microsoft’s senior leaders responsible for managing Microsoft’s cloud service offerings discussing the importance of these topics to their customers and the services they manage.
The first video in the series is now available and I invite you to watch it:
