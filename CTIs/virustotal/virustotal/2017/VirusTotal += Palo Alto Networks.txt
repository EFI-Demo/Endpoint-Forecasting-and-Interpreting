We welcome Palo Alto Networks (Known Signatures) to VirusTotal. This scanner was developed by Palo Alto Networks, headquartered in Santa Clara, CA. In the words of the company:


"Palo Alto Networks is the next-generation security company, leading a new era in cybersecurity by safely enabling applications and preventing cyber breaches for tens of thousands of organizations worldwide. Built with an innovative approach and highly differentiated cyberthreat prevention capabilities, our game-changing security platform delivers superior security, safely enables daily business operations, and protects an organization's most valuable assets.

The Palo Alto Networks (Known Signatures) scanner was built for VirusTotal to identify malicious files by comparing Windows portable executables (PE) file indicators against antivirus signatures from the Palo Alto Networks Threat Intelligence Cloud. The scanner is not a commercially available product, but leverages all of Palo Alto Networks known malicious antivirus signatures.‚Äù

Palo Alto Networks has expressed its commitment to follow the recommendations of AMTSO and, in compliance with our policy, facilitates this review by SE Labs, an AMTSO-member tester.
