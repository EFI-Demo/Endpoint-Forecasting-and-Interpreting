When Cisco Talos launched the first ever Talos Threat Research Summit last year, we never could have anticipated how popular it would be.

Tickets sold out quickly, and our inaugural Talos-backed conference was packed in the days leading up to Cisco Live. This year, we are bringing back the Threat Research Summit, and making it even bigger.

Next year’s Talos Threat Research Summit will take place on June 9 in San Diego, Calif — the same day Cisco Live kicks off. To meet the demand of last year, we are expanding the number of attendees to 500 in 2019 — double what we had last year. 

Tickets won’t go on sale for a few more months, but be sure to follow us on Twitter and Facebook so you can be the first in line.



We also want to take this time to open up submissions for talks this year. The application for presentations at the 2019 Threat Research Summit is open here. To submit your talk, please fill out the provided form, including a short abstract and a description of your proposed talk. All presentations will be 60 minutes with the time including presentation, Q&A and changeover to the next presenter. The 2019 Talos Threat Research Summit will have two tracks with an opening keynote presentation and a closing address from Talos.



We are looking for presenters who can take a deep dive into a specific topic regarding defensive security and defenders. The content selected for the Talos Threat Research Summit will bolster attendee’s security knowledge and facilitate opportunities for defenders to build relationships with their peers, which can be a defender's most powerful resource.



The window for submissions will close on Jan. 25. After that, we will be in touch with additional details if you are selected for the conference.



Please stay tuned to the Talos blog and our social media accounts for more details on the Threat Research Summit, including exact location details and ticket sales.
