Marcin Towalski of Cisco Talos discovered this vulnerability. Blog by Jon Munshaw.The Google Chrome web browser contains a use-after-free vulnerability in its WebGL component that could allow a user to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser process. This vulnerability specifically exists in ANGLE, a compatibility layer between OpenGL and Direct3D that Chrome uses on Windows systems. An adversary could manipulate the memory layout of the browser in a way that they could gain control of the use-after-free exploit, which could ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution. In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with Google to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.Vulnerability detailsGoogle Chrome WebGL use-after-free vulnerability (TALOS-2020-1085/CVE-2020-8620)A use-after-free read vulnerability exists in Google Chrome 81.0.4044.138 (Stable), 84.0.4136.5 (Dev) and 84.0.4143.7 (Canary), when a WebGL component fails to properly handle objects in memory. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the browser process.Read the complete vulnerability advisory here for additional information. Versions testedTalos tested and confirmed that this vulnerability affects Google Chrome, versions 81.0.4044.138 (Stable), 84.0.4136.5 (Dev) and 84.0.4143.7 (Canary).CoverageThe following SNORTⓇ rules will detect exploitation attempts.
