		You might have heard that Microsoft is in the process of buying Skype, the popular Internet video and voice communications company. We thought this would be a good time to show you how to be more secure and help protect your privacy when you use Skype.
Here are our top tips:

Adjust your privacy settings to fit your needs. To update your settings on a Windows computer, open Skype and click Tools > Options > Privacy.
Protect your Skype account with a strong password. Use at least 8 characters and a mix of symbols, numbers, and letters. Get more tips on creating strong passwords.
Beware of fake emails. Cybercriminals often send fake emails that appear to come from legitimate companies (like Microsoft and Skype.) Neither Microsoft nor Skype will ever send an email that asks for personal information like your passwords or a credit card number.
