In today’s complex and regulated environment, businesses need to focus on building more secure solutions that deliver value to their customers, partners, and shareholders—both in the cloud and on-premises.

Microsoft has been building enterprise software for decades and running some of the largest online services in the world. We draw from this experience to keep making SharePoint and OneDrive more secure for users, by implementing and continuously improving security-aware software development, operational management, and threat-mitigation practices that are essential to the strong protection of your services and data.
SharePoint and OneDrive are uniquely positioned to help you address these evolving security challenges. To begin with, Microsoft has continued to evolve with new standards and regulations. This has been a guiding principle as we think about security for SharePoint and OneDrive. Right alongside that principle is this one: There is no security without usability. If security gets in the way of productivity, users will find a different, less secure way to do their work.
SharePoint and OneDrive allow your organization to go beyond its regular business rhythms and be nimbler in responding to market changes and opportunities. These solutions enable users to access the files and documents they need wherever they’re doing work while sharing and collaborating in real-time. And you control and own your data while Microsoft takes care of it. Explore the many options SharePoint and OneDrive provide to secure you and your information and then read our eBook Securing your content in the new world of work with SharePoint and OneDrive.
For businesses, the time is now to reevaluate security practices. In the modern communications and collaboration, landscape connectivity is ubiquitous and the ability to work remotely has become an ingrained part of the work practice. People have come to expect to be able to access email and documents from anywhere on any device – and for that experience to be seamless.
While this has been an enormous boost to productivity, it also presents huge challenges for security. Previously, businesses needed to concern themselves with a firewall that ended at the corporate boundary. Now that boundary has shifted to the end user. Businesses need to ensure sure that corporate data is safe while enabling users to stay productive in today’s mobile-first world, where the threat landscape is increasingly complex and sophisticated.
We know that data loss is non-negotiable, and overexposure to information can have legal and compliance implications. SharePoint and OneDrive provide a broad array of features and capabilities designed to make certain that your sensitive information remains that way with investments across our security and compliance principles to include compliance tools that span on-premises servers and Office 365 while providing a balance between enabling user self-service.
The rapidly-changing security landscape means that your organization’s content – its knowledge – is being shared more broadly, and accessed from more devices and more locations, than ever before. We’re committed to the security, privacy, and compliance of your data, and we continuously innovate intelligent ways to protect your content and to empower you to govern and manage information. Last month we announced label-based classification for information management policies, which enable a more dynamic governance of content across SharePoint, Exchange, and Skype, and Microsoft Teams. We’re continuously working to ensure content usage adheres to corporate policy defending your organization from today’s growing and evolving advanced threats.
