Recorded March 13, 2020

Of course, we have to talk about the implications of coronavirus. It's affecting the way business and security are getting done. While everything about the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be a fluid situation, a rare constant has been the same rehashed disaster scams. But that could quickly change with the mass shift toward remote work. This episode takes a look at both securing that shift as well as practical advice for those of us finding ourselves newly remote employees.
