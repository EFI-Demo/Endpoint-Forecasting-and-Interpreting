It's been more than five years since Google acquired VirusTotal. Today we have another update: VirusTotal will moving to become part of Chronicle, a new Alphabet company focused on cyber security. This update, like our move to Google a few years back, does not change the mission or focus of VirusTotal. We'll continue to operate independently, focused on our mission of helping keep you safe on the web.

For press inquiries, please contact press@chronicle.security
