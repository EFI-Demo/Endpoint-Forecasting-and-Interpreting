Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos discovered this vulnerability.

Foxit PDF Reader contains a remote code execution vulnerability in its JavaScript engine. Foxit aims to be one of the most feature-rich PDF readers on the market, and contains many similar functions to that of Adobe Acrobat Reader. The software uses JavaScript at several different points when opening a PDF. A bug exists in the JavaScript reading function that results in a large amount of memory to be allocated, which quickly uses up all available memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to then gain the ability to remotely execute code.



In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with Foxit to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
