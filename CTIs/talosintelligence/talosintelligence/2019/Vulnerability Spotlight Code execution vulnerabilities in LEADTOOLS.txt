Marcin Towalski and Cory Duplantis of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities. Blog by Jon Munshaw.

Cisco Talos recently discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the LEADTOOLS line of imaging toolkits. LEADTOOLS is a collection of toolkits designed to perform a variety of functions aimed at integrating documents, multimedia and imaging technologies into applications. All of the software is produced by LEAD Technologies Inc. LEADTOOLS offers prebuilt and portable libraries with an SDK for most platforms (Windows, Linux, Android, etc.), that are all geared toward building applications for medical systems. Various pieces of LEADTOOLS contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors to carry out a number of actions, including denial-of-service conditions and the execution of code remotely.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with LEAD Technologies to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.


Vulnerability details
LEADTOOLS TIF ImageWidth code execution vulnerability (TALOS-2019-0876/CVE-2019-5084)

An exploitable heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the TIF-parsing functionality of LEADTOOLS 20. A specially crafted TIF image can cause an offset beyond the bounds of a heap allocation to be written, potentially resulting in code execution. An attacker can specially craft a TIF image to trigger this vulnerability.
