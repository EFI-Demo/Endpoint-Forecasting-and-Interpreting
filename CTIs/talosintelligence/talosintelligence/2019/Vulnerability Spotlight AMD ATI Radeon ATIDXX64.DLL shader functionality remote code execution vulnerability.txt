Piotr Bania of Cisco Talos discovered this vulnerability.

Some AMD Radeon cards contain a remote code execution vulnerability in their ATIDXX64.DLL driver. AMD produces the Radeon line of hardware, which includes graphics cards and graphics processing units. This specific vulnerability exists on the Radeon RX 550 and the 550 Series while running VMWare Workstation 15. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a malformed pixel shared inside the VMware guest operating system to the driver. This could corrupt memory in a way that would allow the attacker to gain the ability to remotely execute code on the victim machine.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with AMD to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
