Recorded 6/24/19 - Back in the studio for EP 56 and off the top, Matt got some new audio toy for his side hustle as a Twitch star - I still can’t figure out exactly how he did what he did, but it was not helpful from a producer’s perspective. It’s repaired, but still enough to apologize for.  This is why we can’t have nice things. We discuss the issues around the AMCA data heist - a breach that caused a bankruptcy - and the complexity of securely moving sensitive data, like PII and HIPAA data, to the cloud. As we get deeper, we end up discussing the issues inherent in medical data - namely, it’s sensitivity and data security issues so systemic in nature that not even HIPAA can help.


The timeline:

01:00 - Roundtable - The usual collection of smack talk - wrong numbers, arson, etc.
10:30 - From breached to bankrupt - AMCA files chap.11 after losing undetermined amounts of data
29:00 - Growing your teams skills and sorting out what you need your consultants to know for you
32:30 - Medical data - a valuable target passing through so many hands
38:30 - Closing shots and parting thoguhts (trying to move the car while Craig is inside paying edition)
