Recorded Dec. 20, 2019 

In a shorter year-end EP, we take both a look back and a look forward. It seems everyone else wants to break out the crystal ball this time of year and prognosticate the coming year’s threat landscape. We don’t have one of those, so we used a Magic 8-ball, but we’re pretty confident the results are as-good or better. Most of this EP is dedicated to going through the notable security events of the past year. We take a look at the lasting effects and lessons learned from 2019’s biggest threats.




The timeline:

00:50 — Roundtable - Security Fortune Telling. Break out the magic 8-ball!
05:50 — Old ASA bug resurfaces, apply the patch from 2018 please. 
09:00 — 2019 notable security events: RATs, and sea turtles, and blue worms, oh my!
34:40 — Closing thoughts and parting shots
