		More than 170K technology and business leaders from across the world depend on Microsoft’s Modern Workplace monthly webcast to shed new light on business challenges related to technology. Over the past four years, Modern Workplace has had the world’s leading experts share their advice on technology topics, such as security, including CISOs, Chief Privacy Officers, Cyber Intelligence Advisors, and Chief Digital Officers. Just in the past year, Modern Workplace security episodes included:

Cyber Intelligence: The Human Element (covering Identity and Access Management)
Cyber Intelligence: Help Prevent a Breach (covering Threat Protection)
The Privacy Balance: Staying Secure and Ethical with Your Data (covering Information Protection)
Data Defense: An Inside Look at Your Secure Cloud (covers Security Management)

These episodes include more than just security checklists and basics—they go into depth around the decisions business leaders are faced with every day. In the episode on data privacy, Hillery Nye, Chief Privacy Officer at Glympse, explained how the startup company made a very conscious decision to not collect data that it could have easily gathered from its real-time location sharing app. The company collects customer data and uses it for very specific purposes, but it never stores or sells that data. The company may have given up some opportunities to monetize its customer data, but Nye feels that the company gains even more by being a responsible corporate citizen and establishing a reputation for privacy. She discussed how a company’s brand is affected by its privacy policies, and how businesses can better align their privacy policies with business strategy for long term success.
The Modern Workplace series has been nominated for four regional Emmy® awards because of its creative presentation of diverse perspectives and insights. To learn more about how technology can help drive your business, check out the Modern Workplace episodes on-demand today!
