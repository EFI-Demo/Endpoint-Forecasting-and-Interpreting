We welcome Cybereason scanner to VirusTotal. In the words of the company: 


“Cybereason has developed a comprehensive platform to manage risk, including endpoint detection and response (EDR) and next generation antivirus (NGAV). Cybereason’s NGAV solution is underpinned by a proprietary machine learning (ML) anti-malware engine that was built and trained to block advanced attacks such as never-before-seen malware, ransomware, and fileless malware. The cloud-enabled engine conducts both static binary analysis and dynamic behavioral analysis to increase detection of known and unknown threats. Files submitted to VirusTotal will be analyzed by Cybereason’s proprietary ML anti-malware engine and the rendered verdicts will be available to VirusTotal users.”

Cybereason has expressed its commitment to follow the recommendations of AMTSO and, in compliance with our policy, facilitates this review by SE Labs, an AMTSO-member tester.
