Cisco Talos researchers recently discovered two code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Excel. Microsoft released updates for these two bugs as part of their Patch Tuesday security update this week. Both vulnerabilities specifically relate to the component in Excel that handles the Microsoft Office HTML and XML file types. An adversary could exploit these vulnerabilities in such a way that would allow them to execute code on the victim machine after tricking the victim into opening a specially crafted Excel file.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with Microsoft to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
