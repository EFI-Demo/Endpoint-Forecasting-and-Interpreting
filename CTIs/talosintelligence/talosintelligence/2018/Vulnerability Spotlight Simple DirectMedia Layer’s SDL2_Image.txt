Overview


Talos is disclosing several vulnerabilities identified in Simple DirectMedia Layer's SDL2_Image library that could allow code execution. Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games, including Valve's award-winning catalog, and many Humble Bundle games. SDL officially supports Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android. Support for other platforms may be found in the source code. The SDL2_Image library is an optional component for SDL that deals specifically with parsing and displaying a variety of image file formats, creating a single and uniform API for image processing, regardless of the type. Simple DirectMedia Layer has released a new version of sdl image, 2.0.3 to address this issue, which can be downloaded here. Talos recommends installing this update as quickly as possible on affected systems.

TALOS-2017-0488/CVE-2017-12122 - Simple DirectMedia Layer SDL2_Image IMG_LoadLBM_RW Code Execution Vulnerability

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the ILBM image rendering functionality of SDL2_image-2.0.2. A specially crafted ILBM image can cause a heap overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker who convinces the user to view a specially crafted image could exploit this vulnerability.


TALOS-2017-0489/CVE-2017-14440 - Simple DirectMedia Layer SDL2_image ILBM CMAP Parsing Code Execution Vulnerability

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the ILBM image rendering functionality of SDL2_image-2.0.2. A specially crafted ILBM image can cause a stack overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker who convinces the user to view a specially crafted image could exploit this vulnerability.


TALOS-2017-0490/CVE-2017-14441 - Simple DirectMedia Layer SDL2_image ICO Pitch Handling Code Execution Vulnerability

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the ICO image rendering functionality of SDL2_image-2.0.2. A specially crafted ICO image can cause an integer overflow, cascading to a heap overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker who convinces the user to view a specially crafted image could exploit this vulnerability.


TALOS-2017-0491/CVE-2017-14442 - Simple DirectMedia Layer SDL2_image Image Palette Population Code Execution Vulnerability

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the BMP image rendering functionality of SDL2_image-2.0.2. A specially crafted BMP image can cause a stack overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker who convinces the user to view a specially crafted image could exploit this vulnerability.
