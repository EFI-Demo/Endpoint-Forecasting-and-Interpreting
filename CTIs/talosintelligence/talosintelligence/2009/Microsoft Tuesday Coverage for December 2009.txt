Six more advisories from Microsoft this month. Coverage is applicable for MS09-070, MS09-071, MS09-072, MS09-073 and MS09-074.There's also a patch or two from Adobe this month. By our count, that's the third "quarterly" patch this quarter. We think we've spotted a trend.Anyway, details are available here: http://www.snort.org/vrt/advisories/2009/12/08/vrt-rules-2009-12-08.html
