Newsletter compiled by Jonathan Munshaw.

Welcome to this week’s Threat Source newsletter — the perfect place to get caught up on all things Talos from the past week.

If you haven’t yet, there’s still time to register for this year’s Talos Threat Research Summit — our second annual conference by defenders, for defenders. This year’s Summit will take place on June 9 in San Diego — the same day Cisco Live kicks off in the same city. We sold out last year, so hurry to register!

We made waves this week with an article on malicious groups on Facebook. We discovered thousands of users who were offering to buy and sell various malicious services, such as carding, spamming and the creation of fake IDs. News outlets across the globe covered this story, including NBC News, Forbes and WIRED.

There’s also new research on the Gustuff malware. Researchers discovered this banking trojan earlier this year, and recently, we tracked it targeting Australian users in the hopes of stealing their login credentials to financial services websites.

Finally, we also have our weekly Threat Roundup, which you can find on the blog every Friday afternoon. There, we go over the most prominent threats we’ve seen (and blocked) over the past week.

Cyber Security Week in Review


WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested in London on Thursday after being extradited from the Ecuadorian embassy. Hours later, the U.S. formally charged him with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. WikiLeaks is responsible for leaking thousands of classified government documents over the years.
Amazon workers reportedly listen to some conversations with Alexa devices in order to improve the software’s voice recognition technology. A handful of employees transcribe the recordings, annotate them and then feed it back into the software.
Yahoo agreed to a $118 million settlement with users over a 2013 data breach. The company, which is now owned by Verizon, affected 3 billion users worldwide, but Yahoo kept it quiet for years.
The U.S. government released a warning regarding the new “HOPLIGHT” malware that appears to originate from North Korea. According to a report from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, the malware has the ability to read, write and move files, connect to a remote host, and upload and download files, among other functions.
Verizon patched a vulnerability in some of its routers that could have allowed an attacker to gain root privileges. This could allow them to target other devices on the network, such as internet-of-things equipment. 
Security researchers bypassed the Samsung Galaxy S10’s fingerprint scanner with a 3-D printed model. This means that attackers could potentially steal users’ fingerprints and then be able to gain physical access to their devices.
Three recent spam campaigns are spreading the TrickBot malware via malicious attachments that disguise themselves as tax documents. The attackers spoof ADP and Paychex, two producers of human resources and payment software.
Cybersecurity companies are pledging to help users remove so-called "stalkerware" from users' smartphones. The companies say they will send alerts to users if this software, which is traditionally used to track other users, is dected on their device.
