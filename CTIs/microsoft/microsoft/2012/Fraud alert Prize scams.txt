I received an email that said that I won a prize from Microsoft and I am concerned that others may fall for this scam. Can’t anything be done about these types of scams?
The Microsoft Lottery scam is a fraudulent email that claims that you have won a lottery, a prize, a sweepstakes, or another kind of award. The goal of this phishing scam is to convince you to send money to claim your award or to turn over personal information.

There is no Microsoft Lottery. If you receive an email like this, you can delete it or you can report it.
