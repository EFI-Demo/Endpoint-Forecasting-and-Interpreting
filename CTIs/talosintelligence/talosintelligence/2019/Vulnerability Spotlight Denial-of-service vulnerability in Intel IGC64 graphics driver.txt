Piotr Bania of Cisco Talos discovered this vulnerability. Blog by Jon Munshaw.

Intel’s IGC64.dll graphics driver contains a denial-of-service vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this bug by supplying a malformed pixel shader if the graphics driver is operating inside a VMware guest operating system. This type of attack can be triggered from VMware guest usermode to cause a denial-of-service attack due to an out-of-bounds read in the driver.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with Intel to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
