Ep. #40 show notes: 
Recorded Oct. 19, 2018 — In celebration of episode No. 40 and hitting over 1 million downloads(!!!), we go XL. This episode is a bit long, but we go a bit deeper than usual to discuss a few things that are highly unusual — namely, the extra-large patches dropped by Oracle, and the extra-large questions surrounding the Bloomberg/Super Micro story. We also talk about a few mobile threats we have seen and what we have brewing in the mobile threat space.

The timeline:



The topics
01:25 — Roundtable: Skeevy JavaScript, Mighty Reds update, potato camera, Joel’s petty HVAC complaints, and whatever Twitter drama Craig is on about.
07:30 — Agent Tesla and Loki playing tricks.
12:30 — What’s next in mobile threats from Talos, and the problem with app store models.
24:04 — Oracle drops 302 patches. Fancy ... some would even say extravagant.
36:30 — The Super Micro Bloomberg incident: What the **** is going on here?
