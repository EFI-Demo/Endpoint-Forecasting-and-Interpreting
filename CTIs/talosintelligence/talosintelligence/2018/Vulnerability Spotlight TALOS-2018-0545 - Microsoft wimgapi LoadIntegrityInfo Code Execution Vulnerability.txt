Vulnerabilities discovered by Marcin Noga from Talos


Overview

Talos is disclosing a remote code execution vulnerability in the Microsoft wimgapi library. The wimgapi DLL is used in the Microsoft Windows operating system to perform operations on Windows Imaging Format (WIM) files. WIM is a file-based disk image format created by Microsoft to simplify the deployment of Windows systems. If an attacker creates a specially crafted WIM file, they could be able to execute malicious code with the same access rights as the logged-in user, or just crash the system with a denial-of-service attack. The vulnerability is related to the file header parsing, which means it gets triggered even on simple operations. WIM files do not have a registered file type handler by default, which means that this vulnerability cannot be triggered by tricking a user into double-clicking a WIM file â€” at least not without registering a file-handler first. This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2018-8210 and a security patch was released as part of the June 2018 Microsoft Patch Tuesday release. The Microsoft advisory can be found here.


Details
The vulnerability exists in the LoadIntegrityInfo functions that manifest during the parsing of a WIM file header. A specially crafted WIM file can lead to a heap corruption, and remote code execution.
The vulnerability triggers, even on the simplest operations performed on a malformed WIM file. For example, it is enough if an application tries to open the WIM file via the WIMCreateFile function and requests a file handle. The function allocates heap memory based on a user-controlled size value, and uses another user-controlled value to read n bytes from the file into this buffer. It is using these values without any prior input checks.

More technical details can be found in the Talos Vulnerability Reports.
