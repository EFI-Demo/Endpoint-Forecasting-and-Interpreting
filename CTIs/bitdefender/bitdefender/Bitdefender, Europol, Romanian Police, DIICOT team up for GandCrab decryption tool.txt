Update June 2019: Our collaboration with the Romanian Police, Europol and other law enforcement agencies has yielded another new decryptor for all GandCrab ransomware versions released, except for v2 and v3. If you need to decrypt versions 1, 4, 5.0.1 through 5.2, then download and run our new tool linked below.
Ransomware has become one of the most profitable cybercrime verticals in recent years. Complex infection mechanisms and highly profitable affiliation schemes brought operators more than $1 billion in 2016.
GandCrab, the latest family of ransomware, started to claim victims in late January, demanding exorbitant prices (ranging from $400 to $700,000) in exchange for the decryptor.
Fortunately, the 50,000 users facing ransom demands can get their data back as Bitdefender has teamed up with Europol , the Romanian Police (IGPR) [announcement is in Romanian] and the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) [announcement is in Romanian] to release a free GandCrab decryption utility.
We are proud to provide our technical expertise in fighting cyber-crime as part of our long-standing mission: to protect the world’s Internet users and organizations.
The free tool, provided by Bitdefender, the Romanian Police, the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) and Europol, works for all known versions of GandCrab and is now ready for download on nomoreransom.org, an online portal available in 28 languages, and in the ransomware decryption tools section on labs.bitdefender.com.
