		A reader of this blog recently received the following suspicious email:
“This Email is from Hotmail Customer Care. We are having congestions due to the anonymous registration of Hotmail accounts so we are shutting down some Hotmail accounts and your account was among those to be deleted. We are sending this email to you so that you can verify and let us know if you still want to use this account.
Due to the congestion in all Hotmail users and removal of all unused Hotmail Accounts, Hotmail would be shutting down all unused accounts. You will have to confirm your E-mail by filling out your Login Info below after clicking the reply button or your account will be suspended within 24 hours for security reasons.”
This email is a scam. It did not come from Microsoft. If you reply with personal information, you could become a victim of ID theft.
If you receive an email like this, delete it. If you already responded with your personal information, read Hotmail hacked? Take these steps. 
The newest version of Hotmail allows you to associate your account with your cell phone number so that you can get back into your account if it’s been compromised. To read more about this feature, see Three new Hotmail security features we love.
