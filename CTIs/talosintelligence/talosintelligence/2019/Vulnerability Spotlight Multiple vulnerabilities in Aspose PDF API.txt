Marcin Noga of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities.

Cisco Talos recently discovered multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities in the Aspose.PDF API. Aspose provides a series of APIs for manipulating or converting a large family of document formats. These vulnerabilities exist in APIs that help process PDFs. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted, malicious file to the target and trick them into opening it while using the corresponding API.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with Aspose to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
