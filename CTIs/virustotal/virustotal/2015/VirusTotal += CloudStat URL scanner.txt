CloudStat is a new platform set to revolutionize the way companies collect and analyze their data. It identifies compliance gaps, detects configuration problems and warns customers of cyber security threats by applying our proprietary analysis engine to millions of data points. It delivers concise actionable reports directly to mobile devices. The team behind CloudStat is dedicated to helping companies mitigate risks, increase productivity and reduce costs.
Let us look at how their verdicts show up:

Judging by the reports, it seems that this new engine nicely complements other datasets, such that aggregate threat coverage has been improved, this is good news. Hopefully this addition results in more secure users world-wide.
