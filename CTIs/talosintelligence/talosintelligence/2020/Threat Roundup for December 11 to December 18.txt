    



Today, Talos is publishing a glimpse into the most
prevalent threats we've observed between Dec. 11 and
Dec. 18. As with previous roundups, this post isn't meant to
be an in-depth analysis. Instead, this post will summarize the threats
we've observed by highlighting key behavioral characteristics,
indicators of compromise, and discussing how our customers are automatically
protected from these threats.


As a reminder, the information provided for the following threats
in this post is non-exhaustive and current as of the date of
publication. Additionally, please keep in mind that IOC searching
is only one part of threat hunting. Spotting a single IOC does not
necessarily indicate maliciousness. Detection and coverage for the
following threats is subject to updates, pending additional threat
or vulnerability analysis. For the most current information, please
refer to your Firepower Management Center,
Snort.org, or
ClamAV.net.



For each threat described below, this blog post only lists 25 of the
associated file hashes and up to 25 IOCs for each category. An
accompanying JSON file can be found here
that includes the complete list of file hashes, as well as all other IOCs
from this post. A visual depiction of the MITRE ATT&CK techniques
associated with each threat is also shown. In these images, the brightness
of the technique indicates how prevalent it is across all threat files where
dynamic analysis was conducted.  There are five distinct shades that are used,
with the darkest indicating that no files exhibited technique behavior and the
brightest indicating that technique behavior was observed from 75 percent or
more of the files.


The most prevalent threats highlighted in this roundup are:

    Exploit Prevention
    
    Cisco AMP for Endpoints protects users from a variety of malware functions with exploit
    prevention. Exploit prevention helps users defend endpoints from memory attacks commonly
    used by obfuscated malware and exploits. These exploits use certain features to bypass
    typical anti-virus software, but were blocked by AMP thanks to its advanced scanning
    capabilities, even protecting against zero-day vulnerabilities.

            A PowerShell command with a very long command line argument that may indicate an obfuscated script has been detected. PowerShell is an extensible Windows scripting language present on all versions of Windows. Malware authors use PowerShell in an attempt to evade security software or other monitoring that is not tuned to detect PowerShell based threats.
        
    
    
        
        
            Smoke Loader detected - (348)
        
    
    
        
            Smoke Loader has been detected. Smokeloader is used mainly to execute other malicious software, like ransomware or cryptocurrency miners. Its initial infection vector is usually an email with a malicious Microsoft Word document or delivered through an exploit kit. Smokeloader uses various plugins designed to steal data from its victims, particularly credentials stored on the system or transfered over HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3 or IMAP.
