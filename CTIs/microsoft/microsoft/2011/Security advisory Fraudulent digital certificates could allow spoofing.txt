		Microsoft released a security advisory today warning about
fraudulent digital certificates that could be used to spoof content, perform
phishing attacks, or perform other exploits that could put you at risk.
The best way to protect yourself is to turn on Windows
automatic updating. 
What are digital certificates?
Digital certificates are used to verify the identity of a website.

We’re releasing this advisory because Comodo, a major
certification authority, informed Microsoft that several digital certificates
have been issued without sufficiently validating their identity. These
certificates could be used to spoof the identity of services and trick you into
trusting them.
Comodo has revoked these certificates, and they are listed
in Comodo’s current Certificate Revocation List (CRL). If your computer is up
to date, it will recognize that these certificates are invalid.
