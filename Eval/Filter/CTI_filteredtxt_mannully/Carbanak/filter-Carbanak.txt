Carbanak copies itself into "%system32%\com" with the name "svchost.exe" with the file attributes: system, hidden and read-only.
The original file created by the exploit payload is then deleted.

Carbanak creates a file with a random name and a .bin extension in %COMMON_APPDATA%\Mozilla where it stores commands to be executed. 

Then the malware gets the proxy configuration from the registry entry: [HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings] and the Mozilla Firefox configuration file in: %AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\<ProfileName>\prefs.js
Additionally, Carbanak can obtain proxy configuration information from headers sent through an application via SOCKS or HTTP.

Carbanak injects its code into svchost.exe. Most of the actions described below happen within this process.
Carbanak downloads the file kldconfig.plug from its C2 server. This file includes the names of the processes to be monitored

Also, after executing this service, it modifies the executable code in memory in order to establish simultaneous work processes for both remote and local users. Modules modified in this process are: termsrv.dll, csrsrv.dll, msgina.dll and winlogon.exe.

If Carbanak detects the banking application BLIZKO (funds transfer software) in the infected computer, it sends a special notification to its C2 server.
To communicate with its C2 server, Carbanak uses the HTTP protocol with RC2+Base64 encryption, adding additional characters not included in Base64. 

It also inserts strings with different extensions (.gif,.htm, etc.) at random locations in the HTTP request.
Specifically, the attackers have been detected uploading: Ammyy Admin 3.5 (f8cd52b70a11a1fb3f29c6f89ff971ec) as svchost.exe

Attackers created fake transactions in the victim's internal database after the verification process, thus avoiding discovery of the fraudulent activity; 
Attackers used the victim's internal command utilities to insert fraudulent operations in the transaction queue.
