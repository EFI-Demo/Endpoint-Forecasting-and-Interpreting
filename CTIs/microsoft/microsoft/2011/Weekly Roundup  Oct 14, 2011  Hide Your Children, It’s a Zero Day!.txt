This week included the release of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (SIR) volume 11, which included some focused research to put “zero-day” exploits in context.  Dark Reading captured the essence of the research with the headline New Microsoft Data Puts Zero-Day Threat Into Perspective, while The Register provided the bottom-line messaging that Crims prefer old exploits: Microsoft.  I’ve got to say that my favorite headline from the SIRv11 coverage came from Tony Bradley’s tongue-in-cheek take on the research in PCWorld: Hide Your Children, It’s a Zero Day!
