We are back with new inclusions in VirusTotal's URL scanning engine. This time we are excited to add Malekal's malicious URL dataset to our aggregate scanner.

Malekal is a site maintained by one of our most active VirusTotal Community users, @Malekal_morte. The site mostly deals with malware and antivirus but has support forums that help users in many other ICT fields. As a result of the support he gives and the research he conducts, Malekal comes across many malware samples an malicious URLs as we can see in his public listing (21211 documented files since March 2010 at the time of this article).

Malekal's malicious URL dataset is now being used to check whether any URL submitted by a user to VirusTotal is present in it and if so it is flagged accordingly. You should now be able to see these detections in the URL reports, just as an example:

We are extremely grateful to Malekal, welcome on board!
