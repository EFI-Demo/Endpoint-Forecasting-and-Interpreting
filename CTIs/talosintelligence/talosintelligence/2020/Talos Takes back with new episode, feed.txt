Talos Takes, our new bite-size podcast, is back with its own feed and a new show.

We first unveiled Talos Takes in early December, and took some time to develop a new Talos Podcasts page to accommodate Talos Takes and Beers with Talos. Now you have two Talos shows you can subscribe to!

We'll be adding Talos Takes to Apple Podcasts, Google Play and other services very soon. For now, you can check out our RSS feed and all episodes here.

Our newest episode focuses on password management, hosted by Nick Biasini and Earl Carter.
