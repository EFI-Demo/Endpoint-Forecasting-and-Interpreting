“I received a message in my Hotmail inbox that said that I’d been hacked and I should change my password. How do I do this?”
If you think your Hotmail account has been hacked, go to the Reset your password page.
Karen didn’t say whether the message appeared to be from Microsoft or if it was from a friend who received an email from her that looked suspicious (a sign that your account might have been hacked.)
If you receive an email about the security of your account, this could be a scam. Don’t click links in any emails unless you trust the sender. Instead, reset your password.
