		In today’s high tech world, individuals from around the globe can comment in real time on others social media posts and current events instantaneously. With just a few keystrokes, data, thoughts and ideas can reach around the world. In this fast paced environment, consideration of what you choose to share and to whom is more important than ever. Likewise, as organizations take advantage of the scale and economies offered by cloud computing, understanding how data is managed by your cloud service provider is a high priority.
Microsoft takes a principled approach to privacy. Our commercial cloud customers own their data and we don’t use it to deliver targeted advertising. At Microsoft, we understand that people will not use technology they cannot trust.
Brendon Lynch, Chief Privacy Officer, talks about Microsoft’s long term, principled approach in a conversation with Microsoft colleague Diane McDade, Sr. Director, Policy Management in the following video:

Microsoft does not engineer back doors into our products
Microsoft has never provided business or government data in response to a national security order
Microsoft will contest any attempt by the US government to disclose customer content stored exclusively overseas
Microsoft is the first cloud provider to meet strict EU standards for international data transfers
