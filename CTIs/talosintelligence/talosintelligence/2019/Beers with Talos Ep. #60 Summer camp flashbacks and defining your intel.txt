Recorded Aug. 16, 2019 — The understatement of the day would be the guys were in some kind of mood when we recorded this. There is no explaining the way they are sometimes. We ended up discussing a lot of the awesome things that went on at Blackhat and DEFCON, like the time Matt and Mitch got ejected from the Aviation Village for recognizing the prowess of the greatest plane ever built. And also the time Joel ejected himself from the Cisco party. Deeper in the episode we get into threat intelligence: What is it, how to find the intel you need, and how do you leverage it to create value?


The timeline:

02:00 — Roundtable: Leeroy Jenkins, gratitude, and a special guest Esler
15:25 — Blackhat and DEFCON recap
51:10 — Threat intelligence: What this means and how you need to be using it
