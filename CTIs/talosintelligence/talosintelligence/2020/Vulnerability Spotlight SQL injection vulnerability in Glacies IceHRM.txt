Cisco Talos researchers recently discovered that the Glacies' IceHRM software contains a vulnerability that could allow an adversary to inject SQL. IceHRM is a human resource management tool, allowing users to create and track timesheets for employees, upload documents and manage payroll. An attacker could send the software a specially crafted HTTP request, which can open the door for SQL injection. This could allow the attacker to access information such as usernames and password hashes stored in the software's database.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with Glacies to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
