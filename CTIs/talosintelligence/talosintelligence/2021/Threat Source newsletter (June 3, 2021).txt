The group reportedly gained access to a Constant Contact email marketing account belonging to USAID. The campaigns attempted to lure victims in by sending them themed documents invoking former President Donald Trump. The malicious documents would eventually download a DLL that gave Nobelium a backdoor to the victim machine.JBS, one of the world's largest producers of meat, had to shut down operations at some of its plants for several days after a cyber attack. As of Thursday, the company restored most of its services.The FBI blamed the attack on the infamous REvil ransomware group. A representative from the group said in October the group was likely to target the agricultural sector next.Multiple notable transportation systems revealed they were the victims of cyber attacks earlier this year. The ferry in Martha's Vineyard was compromised this week, while New York City's MTA revealed an attack back in April that did not result in any compromised data belonging to riders.The White House released a memo warning private companies' executives of the recent increase in cyber attacks.

Attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to cause a denial of service on connected devices, privilege escalation and code execution. The Home Network Security Station is an all-in-one device that protects users’ home networks by scanning for vulnerabilities on connected devices and serves as an intrusion prevention system. An attacker could manipulate the device in a way, using these vulnerabilities, that could allow them to execute remote code on the device or takeover PCs that are connected to the targeted home network. Snort SIDs: 51719 - 57122 Title: Multiple vulnerabilities in Accusoft ImageGear Description: Cisco Talos researchers recently discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Accusoft ImageGear. The ImageGear library is a document-imaging developer toolkit that allows users to create, edit, annotate and convert various images. It supports more than 100 file formats such as DICOM, PDF, Microsoft Office. These vulnerabilities Talos discovered could allow an attacker to carry out various malicious actions, including corrupting memory on the victim machine and gaining the ability to execute remote code. CVE-2021-21793, CVE-2021-21794 and CVE-2021-21824 are all out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities that exist in various functions of the software. An attacker could trigger these vulnerabilities by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted, malicious file. Snort SIDs: 54411 - 54414, 57249 - 57252, 57270 - 57273, 57301, 57302, 57378, 57379 Most prevalent malware files this weekSHA 256: c1d5a585fce188423d31df3ea806272f3daa5eb989e18e9ecf3d94b97b965f8eMD5: 9a4b7b0849a274f6f7ac13c7577daad8 Typical Filename: ww31.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: W32.GenericKD:Attribute.24ch.1201SHA 256: 583418f8f4c156be56ae65b932ca1d8e431e8f845806d0fc814f40562241fbc4 MD5: 52ed8d8b8f1d37b7db0319a3351f6a16 Typical Filename: smbscanlocal2705.exe Claimed Product: N/A Detection Name: W32.Auto:583418f8f4.in03.Talos SHA 256: 8b4216a7c50599b11241876ada8ae6f07b48f1abe6590c2440004ea4db5becc9MD5: 34560233e751b7e95f155b6f61e7419a Typical Filename: SAntivirusService.exe Claimed Product: A n t i v i r u s S e r v i c e Detection Name: PUA.Win.Dropper.Segurazo::tpd  SHA 256: 3bc24c618151b74ebffb9fbdaf89569fadcce6682584088fde222685079f7bb9 MD5: d709ea22945c98782dc69e996a98d643 Typical Filename: FlashHelperService.exe Claimed Product: Flash Helper Service Detection Name: W32.Auto:3bc24c6181.in03.Talos SHA 256: e3eeaee0af4b549eae4447fa20cfe205e8d56beecf43cf14a11bf3e86ae6e8bd MD5: 8193b63313019b614d5be721c538486b Typical Filename: SAService.exe Claimed Product: SAService Detection Name: PUA.Win.Dropper.Segurazo::95.sbx.tg Keep up with all things Talos by following us on Twitter. Snort, ClamAV and Immunet also have their own accounts you can follow to keep up with their latest updates.
