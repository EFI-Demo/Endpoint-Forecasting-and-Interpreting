		The Microsoft Graph Security API, which launched this spring, is a unified REST API for integrating data and intelligence from Microsoft products, services, and partners. Using Microsoft Graph, developers can easily build applications that consolidate and correlate security alerts from multiple sources, unlock contextual data to inform investigations, and automate security operations for greater efficiency.
We just launched a new sample app that makes it easier than ever for developers to get started. Similar to the Python sample and C# sample, currently available, the new JavaScript sample app provides ready-to-run code to:

Display a list of all security alerts for a tenant. Filter by top alerts, category, provider, and severity, or alerts related to a particular user or device.
View rich alert details in JSON.
Show additional information from Microsoft Graph about a user or device.
Update the status of an alert, provide feedback, and add comments.
Subscribe to notifications of all new and updated alerts that meet your filters.

Get started with the JavaScript sample app today!
