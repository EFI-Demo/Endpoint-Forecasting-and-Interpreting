		The latest volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (SIR) is now available for free download at www.microsoft.com/sir.
We’ve been publishing threat intelligence reports for our customers, partners and the industry for 10 years now. During that time, we’ve published over 12,500 pages of threat intelligence, 100+ blog posts, many videos, and delivered thousands of customer briefings all over the world.
This new volume of the report includes threat data from the second half of 2015 as well as longer term trend data on industry vulnerabilities, exploits, malware, and malicious websites. The report also provides deep dive threat data for over 100 countries/regions.
There are a couple of new sections in this volume of the SIR that I’m excited to share.
First, the report includes a section called “PLATINUM: Targeted attacks in South and Southeast Asia.” This section provides details on a newly discovered determined adversary group, which Microsoft has code-named PLATINUM. This group has conducted several cyber espionage campaigns since 2009, focusing on targets associated with governments and related organizations in southeast Asia. This information can help you understand mitigations that can significantly reduce the risks that organizations face from such groups.
The other section I’m excited about is called “Protecting Identities in the Cloud: Mitigating Password Attacks.” This section of the report focuses on some of the things that Microsoft does to prevent account compromise inside our cloud services. This is the first time we’ve published data like this in the SIR.
There is a lot of other new data in this report that I hope you’ll find useful.
