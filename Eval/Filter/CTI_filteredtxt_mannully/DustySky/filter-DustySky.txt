The archive contains an .exe file, sometimes disguised as a Microsoft Word file, a video, or another file format, using the corresponding icon. 

Upon execution of the malicious version (2f452e90c2f9b914543847ba2b431b9a) the legitimate iMazing is installed, while in the background 

DustySky is dropped as a file named Plugin.exe (1d9612a869ad929bd4dd16131ddb133a), and executed: Plugin.exe immediately starts communicating with its command and control sever using the hardcoded address ns.suppoit[.]xyz and supo.mefound[.]com, both also pointing to above mentioned 45.32.13.169.
DustySky Core is dropped to %TEMP% and runs using either cmd or the .NET interface. 

When ordered by the command and control server, the keylogger is extracted and executed. Keylogging logs are saved to %TEMP%\temps . 

For VM evasion the dropper checks whether there is a DLL that indicate that the malware is running in a virtual machine (vboxmrxnp.dll and vmbusres.dll which indicate vitualbox and vmGuestlib.dll which indicates vmware). 
The dropper's resources are two components that are dropped at run time. One is the lure document (internally called "news"), which is presented to the victim once the dropper is executed. The other is DustySky Core, a Trojan backdoor, (internally called "log").
