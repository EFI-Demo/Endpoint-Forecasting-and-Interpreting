The Cisco Talos Incident Response "Stories from the Field" video series returns with another entry from Matt Aubert.

This time, Matt discusses ransomware infections he's seen in real-time, and shares what defenders can learn from others' mistakes and recovery.

Is it ever smart to pay attackers' request extortion payment? Which ransomware families should organizations be most worried about? Matt covers all of this in just six minutes.

You can watch the full video above or over on our YouTube page here. You can get all of the Stories from the Field videos in one place on our playlist, too.
