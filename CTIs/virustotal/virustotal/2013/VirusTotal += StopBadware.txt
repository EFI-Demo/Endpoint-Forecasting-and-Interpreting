StopBadware is a nonprofit anti-malware organization based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our work makes the Web safer through the prevention, mitigation, and remediation of badware websites. We protect people and organizations from becoming victims of viruses, spyware, scareware, and other badware.
This is the way the StopBadware team describes itself, a pretty awesome initiative that has managed to bring together many partners. From now onward VirusTotal users will also be able to take advantage of their URL verdicts.

StopBadware numbers are very impressive, since their launch they have managed to:

inform over 700,000 website owners about how to remediate their compromised sites and prevent future attack
serve more than 10 million Google and Firefox users with content about how to mitigate their risk of badware infection
help de-blacklist over 100,000 websites flagged by our data providers for badware
enlist more than 50 web hosting providers from 22 countries (and counting) in the We Stop Badware™ Web Host program, which helps those providers respond more quickly and effectively to reports of badware on their networks


Without doubt, this integration will bring great value to VirusTotal, thank you StopBadware!
