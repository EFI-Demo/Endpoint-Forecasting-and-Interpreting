Recorded June 24, 2020

Has it been three years already? We have a great episode to celebrate! We start off chatting about the origins of BWT and what made it… I don’t know… the way that it is.  We also have some great guests. Hazel and Ben from the Security Stories podcast come by to talk about another anniversary of note to all of us — NotPetya. We also chat about what makes storytelling a powerful tool (even in security), and atypical paths to careers in cybersecurity. While we are talking about communication, we wrap up this episode discussing and sharing what worked (and still works) for Talos over the series of critical response events that included NotPetya and one of our very first podcast episodes.


 The timeline:

01:15 — Roundtable: It’s Ok to not be OK, Nigel is confused, Mitch is a time warlock
06:20 — BWT: The (probably retconned) origin story 
10:00 — Hazel and Ben from Security Stories 
20:00 — Is Wendy Nather every security podcast’s favorite guest?
31:00 — Communication in response: What we learned between WannaCry and NotPetya
42:00 — Closing thoughts, parting shots
