Cisco Talos recently discovered two denial-of-service vulnerabilities in the web API functionality of Intel RAID Web Console 3. The Raid Web Console is a web-based application that provides several 
configuration functions for the Intel RAID line of products, which includes controllers and storage expanders. The console monitors, maintains and troubleshoots these products. An attacker could exploit both of these bugs by sending a malicious POST request to the API.

In accordance with our coordinated disclosure policy, Cisco Talos worked with Intel to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers.
