Recorded July 8, 2019 — Matt skipped this episode podcast in favor of a meeting (for real).  The rest of the crew carried on to discuss a few of this week’s hot-button issues, such as municipalities paying (or not paying) the ransom, NASA JPL reporting APT breached their network via a rogue Pi (in true Mr. Robot fashion), and looking at rogue devices in general. Next episode will be our last before Black Hat and DEFCON, so tune in to find out where you can find Talos at those conferences.


The timeline:

01:30 — Roundtable: Craig has a terrible internet plan, just saying.
10:45 — Paying the ransom, yeah or nah? If so, when?
21:00 — NASA JPL finds an  APT with their fingers in the Raspberry Pi
40:00 — Can owned and rogue devices be used for hunting?
49:00 — Closing shots and parting thoughts.
