		This week at //build 2019, we’re announcing several enhancements to our identity platform for developers. These enhancements are designed to support the more than one million active third-party applications using our identity platform each month and include:

Our work to unify the Microsoft identity platform across personal accounts and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) accounts.
Our new unified app registrations portal.
The Microsoft Authentication Libraries.
Ability to use your GitHub identity to sign in to Microsoft products.

Head over the Identity blog for a closer look at these enhancements for developers. If you’re at //build this week stop by the Microsoft identity platform and Azure AD booths.
