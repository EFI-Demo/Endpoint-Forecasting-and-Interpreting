We are excited to announce that we have just integrated Blueliv's malicious URL tracker in virustotal, as yet one more URL scanner providing verdicts on URLs submitted by users. In their own words:

Blueliv is a leading provider of cyber threat information and analysis intelligence for large enterprises, service providers, and security vendors. The company’s deep expertise, data sources, and cloud-based platform address a comprehensive range of cyber threats to turn global threat data into real-time actionable intelligence specifically for each client in an easy-to-use dashboard. Blueliv’s clients include leading bank, insurance, telecom, utility, and retail enterprises.
At present, Blueliv's tracker is highly focused on sites used as C&C infrastructure for trojans, URLs distributing malware and sites with exploit kits, an example of their detections can be found in the following reports:

Hopefully this integration will lead to increased knowledge about threats and will help protect users world-wide.
