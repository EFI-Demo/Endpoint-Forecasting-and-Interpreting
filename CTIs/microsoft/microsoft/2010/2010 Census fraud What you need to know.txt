		A new decade is upon us, which means the presence of all kinds of “Best of the Decade” lists and a new United States Census. Much has changed in ten years, including the rise of identity theft, especially on the Internet.

The Better Business Bureau recommends that you “be cooperative, but cautious” when approached by Census workers, either online, by mail, or at your front door.  If someone comes to your door claiming to be a Census Bureau employee, ask for identification such as a Census Bureau badge, handheld device, Census Bureau canvas bag, and a confidentiality notice. 

Official employees might ask for basic financial information, such as your salary range, but they will not ask for the following information:

·         Social Security numbers

·         Credit card information

·         Banking information

·         Donations

DO NOT provide this information if you are asked for it.
