Continuing the trend of engine inclusions we have just added ADMINUSLabsÂ as a new URL scanner. In words of ADMINUSLabs itself:

ADMINUSLABS has built an incredibly robust and comprehensive binaries and malware collection and analysis set of tools, enabling organizations of all sizes to leverage the data analyzed and threats monitored to build better defense system. With clients and partners in every continent, ADMINUSLABS solutions offer industry leading technology, flexibility, cost effectiveness, and service levels.
ADMINUSLabs has shared its malicious URL dataset with VirusTotal, from now on, whenever a user submits a URL to VirusTotal for scanning it will also get checked against ADMINUSLabs' dataset and flagged as malicious if present in it. This is an example of a report with one such detection:

ADMINUSLabs' dataset is very large and gets updated several times per day with thousands of new URLs, this is an excellent addition, many thanks and welcome on board!
