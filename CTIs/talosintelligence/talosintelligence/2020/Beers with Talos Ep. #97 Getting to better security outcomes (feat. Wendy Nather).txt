The results and findings of the research are interesting and somewhat surprising. As often happens with most good research, we end up asking more questions — in this case, geared toward the nature of the relationships found in the data. Special thanks to Wendy for coming on and joining us.  As usual, her insight is stellar and she is much more entertaining than the rest of us. The timeline:01:00 — Roundtable 03:00 — Wendy Nather breaks down the data science of the Security Outcomes Study09:00 — Matt breaks down what adds zero value to success13:00 — Behaviors of security success: cause, effect, and correlation21:30 — Security success contributors in NIST terms25:40 — You heard her… but she’s right, you know.31:00 — ADHD sparkle into closing shots, parting thoughts The links:[Report] Cisco Security Outcomes Study[Blog] Wendy Nather - Does protection help as much as we think?==========Featuring: Matt Olney (@kpyke)Hosted by Mitch Neff (@MitchNeff)Special guest: Wendy Nather (@WendyNather)Subscribe via iTunes (and leave a review!)Check out the Talos Threat Research BlogSubscribe to the Threat Source newsletterFollow Talos on TwitterGive us your feedback and suggestions for topics: beerswithtalos@cisco.com
