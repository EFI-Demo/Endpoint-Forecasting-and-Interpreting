		If you’re searching for news about or pictures of Osama bin Laden, you might find malware instead. This week the FBI warned computer users to be especially careful of emails that claim to show photos or videos of bin Laden’s death.
Cybercriminals are quick to put up fraudulent websites that people will find when they’re searching for popular news topics. These sites often contain fake security software that tries to trick you into downloading malware by making you think that your security is at risk.
Only click links on websites that you trust. If you’re on a news website and you see a pop-up window that advertises security software, do not click it. Computerworld reports that these risks apply to people who use either the Windows or the Mac operating system.
Here are two free ways to help protect yourself:

Download and install Internet Explorer 9, which includes the SmartScreen Filter, which will warn you about or block dangerous websites.
Download and install Microsoft Security Essentials to help protect against viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.
