		We carry a mind-boggling amount of information on our phones
these days. And yet, we’re not always that careful with them. If you lose your
new Windows Phone, you can use the Find My Phone feature to protect your data
in several ways:


If you think your phone is close by but you
don’t have access to another phone, go to windowsphone.live.com
on any computer and make your phone ring. 

If your phone is farther away, go to windowsphone.live.com
and map your phone’s location.

If you’re worried about someone getting to your
phone before you do, you can lock your phone or even erase
it, remotely.

a lost phone.

Phone: Help and How-to.
