		There’s a new scam out there and it involves—puppies. That’s right. Puppies. If you get an e-mail message from someone you don’t know, and it involves puppies, be careful. It might be an advanced fee fraud or a phishing scam.
Advanced fee fraud and phishing scams use e-mail and fraudulent Web sites that are designed to steal your money or your personal information. Recently, these kinds of scams have evolved into a type of elaborate social engineering fraud that aims to prey on your sympathy, or offer you deals that seem too good to be true.
In the case of the puppy scam, classified ads in newspapers and on the Web, or messages sent directly to your e-mail inbox offer free puppies (you just pay the shipping costs) or offer purebred puppies at a discounted price. In each case, the victim sends the money, but the puppy never arrives.
