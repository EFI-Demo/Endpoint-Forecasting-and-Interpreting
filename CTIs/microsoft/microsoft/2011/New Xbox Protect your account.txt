		Whether your family is getting a new Xbox this holiday season or you want to upgrade the security on your current Xbox, here are our top tips.
Password protect your Xbox LIVE profile. Use a strong password to protect your profile. This is especially important if you or your family plan to download your Xbox LIVE profile or gamertag at someone else’s house so you can play on their console.
Learn how to control access to your account.
Add additional security proofs to your Windows Live ID. Add a mobile phone number, email address, secret question or other information to your account. If your password is stolen, this extra information can help you reset it. Think of this as making an extra copy of the keys to your house. To do this, go to the Manage security info webpage, and then sign in with your Windows Live ID.
Be alert for phishing scams. Phishing scams are designed to trick you into revealing personal information. One trick that cybercriminals use is to offer you deals that are too good to be true. Microsoft will never ask for your Windows Live ID password in an email or over the phone. Enter your Windows Live ID password only at known Microsoft trusted sites or through the Xbox 360 console.
